When enabled , this will ensure that each pixel of an image gets mapped to a pixel on the screen .
This is the distance in pixels where Guide and Grid snapping activates .
Tools such as fuzzy-select and bucket fill find regions based on a seed-fill algorithm . The seed fill starts at the initially selected pixel and progresses in all directions until the difference of pixel intensity from the original is greater than a specified threshold . This value represents the default threshold .

Calibration checklist
Before calibrating the display , it is recommended to configure your display with the following settings to get optimal results .
You may want to consult the owner 's manual for your display on how to achieve these settings .
Disable dynamic contrast if your display has this feature .
Adjust the display brightness to a comfortable level for prolonged viewing .
For best results , the display should have been powered for at least 15 minutes before starting the calibration .
Check Settings

Higher quality calibration requires many color samples and more time .
A higher precision profile provides higher accuracy in color matching but requires more time for reading the color patches .
For a typical workflow , a normal precision profile is sufficient .
The high precision profile also requires more paper and printer ink .

Benchmark Settings
Benchmarking involves measuring the transfer rate on various area of the device as well as measuring how long it takes to seek from one random area to another . Please back up important data before using the write benchmark .
Transfer Rate
Benchmarking the write-rate of a disk requires exclusive access to the disk ( e.g. the disk or its partitions cannot be mounted or in use ) and involves reading data and then writing it back . As a result , the contents of the disk is not changed . If not checked , the write-part of the benchmark will not be done but on the other hand exclusive access to the device is not needed ( e.g. the disk or device can be in use ) .
Number of samples . Bigger number produces a more accurate picture of access time patterns but takes more time .
Access Time
Number of samples . Bigger number produces more smooth graphs but the benchmark will take more time .

Name to identify panel
This is a human readable name which you can use to identify a panel . Its main purpose is to serve as the panel 's window title which is useful when navigating between panels .
With a multi-screen setup , you may have panels on each individual screen . This key identifies the current screen the panel is displayed on .

In a Xinerama setup , you may have panels on each individual monitor . This key identifies the current monitor the panel is displayed on .
Expand to occupy entire screen width
If true , the panel will occupy the entire screen width ( height if this is a vertical panel ) . In this mode the panel can only be placed at a screen edge . If false , the panel will only be large enough to accommodate the applets , launchers and buttons on the panel .
Panel orientation
The orientation of the panel . Possible values are " top " , " bottom " , " left " , " right " . In expanded mode the key specifies which screen edge the panel is on . In un-expanded mode the difference between " top " and " bottom " is less important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel - but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects should behave . For example , on a " top " panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel , whereas on a " bottom " panel the menu will be popped up above the panel .
Panel size
The height ( width for a vertical panel ) of the panel . The panel will determine at runtime a minimum size based on the font size and other indicators . The maximum size is fixed at one quarter of the screen height ( or width ) .
Automatically hide panel into corner
If true , the panel is automatically hidden into a corner of the screen when the pointer leaves the panel area . Moving the pointer to that corner again will cause the panel to re-appear .
If true , hiding and un-hiding of this panel will be animated rather than happening instantly .
Enable hide buttons
If true , buttons will be placed on each side of the panel which may be used to move the panel to edge of the screen , leaving only a button showing .
Enable arrows on hide buttons
If true , arrows will be placed on the hide buttons . This key is only relevant if the enable _ buttons key is true .

Fit image to panel
If true , the image will be scaled ( retaining the aspect ratio of the image ) to the panel height ( if horizontal ) .
Stretch image to panel
If true , the image will be scaled to the panel dimensions . The aspect ratio of the image will not be maintained .
Rotate image on vertical panels
If true , the background image will be rotated when the panel is oriented vertically .

KDE Performance You can configure settings that improve KDE performance here .
Konqueror Performance You can configure several settings that improve Konqueror performance here . These include options for reusing already running instances and for keeping instances preloaded .
Disables the minimization of memory usage and allows you to make each browsing activity independent from the others
With this option activated , only one instance of Konqueror used for file browsing will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment , no matter how many file browsing windows you open , thus reducing resource requirements . Be aware that this also means that , if something goes wrong , all your file browsing windows will be closed simultaneously
With this option activated , only one instance of Konqueror will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment , no matter how many browsing windows you open , thus reducing resource requirements . Be aware that this also means that , if something goes wrong , all your browsing windows will be closed simultaneously .
If non-zero , this option allows keeping Konqueror instances in memory after all their windows have been closed , up to the number specified in this option . When a new Konqueror instance is needed , one of these preloaded instances will be reused instead , improving responsiveness at the expense of the memory required by the preloaded instances .
If enabled , an instance of Konqueror will be preloaded after the ordinary KDE startup sequence . This will make the first Konqueror window open faster , but at the expense of longer KDE startup times ( but you will be able to work while it is loading , so you may not even notice that it is taking longer ) .
Minimize Memory Usage
Preloading
Preload an instance after KDE startup
Always try to have at least one preloaded instance

The fonts shown are your personal fonts . To see ( and install ) system-wide fonts , click on the " Administrator Mode " button below .
Font Installer This module allows you to install TrueType , Type1 , and Bitmap fonts . You may also install fonts using Konqueror : type fonts : / into Konqueror 's location bar and this will display your installed fonts . To install a font , simply copy it into the appropriate folder - " Personal " for fonts available to just yourself , or " System " for system-wide fonts ( available to all ) . NOTE : As you are not logged in as " root " , any fonts installed will only be available to you . To install fonts system-wide , use the " Administrator Mode " button to run this module as " root " .
Detailed View
Output :
Configure fonts for legacy X applications
Modern applications use a system called " FontConfig " to obtain the list of fonts . Older applications , such as OpenOffice 1. x , GIMP 1. x , etc. use the previous " core X fonts " mechanism for this . Selecting this option will inform the installer to create the necessary files so that these older applications can use the fonts you install . Please note , however , that this will slow down the installation process .
Configure fonts for Ghostscript
You have enabled a previously disabled option . Would you like the config files updated now ? ( Normally they are only updated upon installing , or removing , a font . )
Do Not Update
Only fonts may be installed . If installing a fonts package ( * % 1 ) , then extract the components , and install individually .

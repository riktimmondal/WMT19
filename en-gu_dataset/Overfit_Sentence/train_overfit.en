Are you sure you want to cancel the calibration ?
Any existing screen correction will be temporarily turned off and the brightness set to maximum .
You can cancel this process at any stage by pressing the cancel button .
To view details about the new profile or to undo the calibration visit the control center .
Before calibrating the display , it is recommended to configure your display with the following settings to get optimal results .
You may want to consult the owner 's manual for your display on how to achieve these settings .
Disable dynamic contrast if your display has this feature .
Adjust the display brightness to a comfortable level for prolonged viewing .
For best results , the display should have been powered for at least 15 minutes before starting the calibration .
These tools are required to build color profiles for devices .
Common color target files are not installed on this computer .
Color target files are needed to convert the image to a color profile .
If you already have the correct file , you can skip this step .
Ensure that the contrast and brightness are not changed and color correction profiles have not been applied .
Ensure that the white-balance has not been modified by the camera and that the lens is clean .
Select the monitor type that is attached to your computer .
Please indicate if you want to profile a local printer , generate some test patches , or profile using existing test patches .
Higher quality calibration requires many color samples and more time .
A higher precision profile provides higher accuracy in color matching but requires more time for reading the color patches .
For a typical workflow , a normal precision profile is sufficient .
The high precision profile also requires more paper and printer ink .
Choose a title to identify the profile on your system .
You need to insert sensor hardware to continue .

Benchmarking involves measuring the transfer rate on various area of the device as well as measuring how long it takes to seek from one random area to another . Please back up important data before using the write benchmark .
Benchmarking the write-rate of a disk requires exclusive access to the disk ( e.g. the disk or its partitions cannot be mounted or in use ) and involves reading data and then writing it back . As a result , the contents of the disk is not changed . If not checked , the write-part of the benchmark will not be done but on the other hand exclusive access to the device is not needed ( e.g. the disk or device can be in use ) .
Number of samples . Bigger number produces a more accurate picture of access time patterns but takes more time .

KDE Performance You can configure settings that improve KDE performance here .
Konqueror Performance You can configure several settings that improve Konqueror performance here . These include options for reusing already running instances and for keeping instances preloaded .
Disables the minimization of memory usage and allows you to make each browsing activity independent from the others
With this option activated , only one instance of Konqueror used for file browsing will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment , no matter how many file browsing windows you open , thus reducing resource requirements . Be aware that this also means that , if something goes wrong , all your file browsing windows will be closed simultaneously
With this option activated , only one instance of Konqueror will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment , no matter how many browsing windows you open , thus reducing resource requirements . Be aware that this also means that , if something goes wrong , all your browsing windows will be closed simultaneously .
If non-zero , this option allows keeping Konqueror instances in memory after all their windows have been closed , up to the number specified in this option . When a new Konqueror instance is needed , one of these preloaded instances will be reused instead , improving responsiveness at the expense of the memory required by the preloaded instances .
If enabled , an instance of Konqueror will be preloaded after the ordinary KDE startup sequence . This will make the first Konqueror window open faster , but at the expense of longer KDE startup times ( but you will be able to work while it is loading , so you may not even notice that it is taking longer ) .
Always try to have at least one preloaded instance

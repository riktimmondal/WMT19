This ship is pow@@ ered by something called a ph@@ an@@ tom dri@@ ve.
My name was J@@ or@@ -@@ E@@ l.
Sir, this is one of the most wanted terror@@ ist@@ s in the world.
Uh, this one's not wor@@ king.
Not to sound me@@ lo@@ dra@@ m@@ atic but it's been known to give a few people second though@@ ts about the job.
So, what are you think@@ ing?
What about poor Par@@ meni@@ on? Get out!
If they want swee@@ ts, they should buy their own.
T@@ old you I did not miss my call.
I don't care what E@@ s@@ ther fucking R@@ an@@ t@@ zen said on That's Li@@ f@@ e, these are bon@@ a f@@ ide heal@@ th supp@@ le@@ ment@@ s, not re@@ -@@ pack@@ ag@@ ed P@@ ur@@ ple H@@ ear@@ ts.
What we call God de@@ pen@@ ds upon our tri@@ be, Clar@@ k J@@ o.
Maybe that's a place.
All of us together, protec@@ ting each other.
No wonder kids are so mes@@ sed up!
We came here looking for work.
- ...@@ ten years ago.
Is he drin@@ king?
How am I do@@ in@@ '?
(@@ THE N@@ IGH@@ T H@@ AN@@ K W@@ IL@@ LI@@ AM@@ S C@@ AM@@ E TO T@@ O@@ W@@ N PLAYING)
But the question is, why should I let you li@@ ve?
That's the deal.
To each his own.
No. You don't understand@@ ?
We got a fire to go to.
Vinc@@ ent, look he's not here.
The night is dark and full of terror@@ s.
And in honor of them, those of you who set out with us seven long years ago I p@@ ron@@ oun@@ ce all your deb@@ ts paid for@@ th@@ with from the ro@@ yal trea@@ sur@@ y.
And use that to foc@@ us.
She don't deserve to be trea@@ ted that way.
I'm afraid of the Mis@@ s@@ us.
The doc@@ tor came about 11@@ :@@ 3@@ 0.
You're a lucky man.
- That's the long shot.
It is rememb@@ ered now?
I imagine right now you're rather cross with me.
You just gotta twi@@ st and tur@@ n@@ ... same as the eel in that fr@@ ying p@@ an.
You won't find them
I hope that the pro@@ pri@@ et@@ or won't be ang@@ ry with us@@ -- that he won't be@@ -- won't be ang@@ ry.
# While my heart stand@@ s still@@ ?
R@@ ev@@ ati@@ , R@@ am was amaz@@ ing.

From what I've tast@@ ed and des@@ ire hold with those who fav@@ or fire.

You won't be hear@@ ing from me for a while.
Have you ever had a single mom@@ en@@ t's thought about my responsibil@@ iti@@ es?

There's a fing@@ er@@ pr@@ int lock on the door.
In here is where we keep all the dri@@ ed goo@@ ds and the can@@ ned goo@@ ds.
Yeah, just put that thing down.
Whoa, man.

You think so?
We're in position.

I am trans@@ m@@ itting it on all wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th@@ s, but nothing is getting out, Cooper.
You shouldn't have run from the guar@@ ds.
I just don't think your boo@@ k@@ sh@@ el@@ f@@ 's trying to talk to you.

Isn't their survi@@ val more important than your pri@@ de?
On a farm@@ ?
We'll never get through that door.

He said suit up, so suit up.
Who is spea@@ king?

I think a Ma@@ id@@ en@@ poo@@ l girl would remember that.
Tra@@ de s@@ kill@@ s and ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es.
Find out what you can from this.
What are you doing here? Let me tell your story.
Ala@@ i, come and expla@@ in.
Take car@@ e, guys.
I even inv@@ ited Fitzpatri@@ ck@@ 's mis@@ er@@ able wife.
I can't per@@ mit you to insu@@ lt the soldi@@ er@@ s...
Will you shut up and drive before one of these ner@@ ds ask me another question.
I'm cra@@ shing the White House.

This new land is very different from the one we left.
I'm sing@@ le.
Don't use that t@@ one with me!
Why doesn't he wonder who you're talking to on the phone right now?
Vinc@@ ent, look at me.
You're not going to kill your best as@@ set.
Come out, come out, w@@ her@@ ever you are.
Now, you can just leave him right outta this.
See what he's done to my la@@ ure@@ l?
Just come home, please.
Do not go gent@@ le into that good night
Like he had on an in@@ vi@@ si@@ ble co@@ at that would shi@@ eld him from this place.
Sometimes I just like to walk around there, looking for a good shot.
I'm Mr. N@@ ort@@ on, the war@@ den.
Fir@@ st, no one is sear@@ ching for both of you
Is this you?
He's not in this shit.

Got you out of the laun@@ dr@@ y, though@@ ?
Spea@@ king of work, how@@ 's Jim@@ ?

Fin@@ ders kee@@ per@@ s, don't be too smar@@ t.
Sorry about the m@@ ess.

They ri@@ pped off the dat@@ ab@@ a@@ se of every loc@@ ation that hou@@ ses the final comp@@ on@@ ent that they ne@@ ed.
In the first place it is when we're said the wi@@ lt marry me.
I'm leaving now.
Got you out of the laun@@ dr@@ y, though.
That's probably the only thing you'll ever do for him.
Mor@@ ning, all.
The direc@@ tor was running behin@@ d.
No, we'll be fine, we'll be fine.
- Then Gree@@ k ways are wea@@ k.
He's got it on him.
We are the ones who have Okj@@ a.
He broke my fucking no@@ se!
Let's go over that tra@@ jec@@ tor@@ y one more time.
E@@ h, a mon@@ th.

You didn't think I was listen@@ ing,
Shaw lea@@ ds to Le@@ tt@@ y.
Did someone die that you didn't turn up?
I sent away for a cop@@ y of that "@@ Li@@ fe M@@ aga@@ z@@ in@@ e@@ "@@ ... with your picture on the co@@ ver.
He says R@@ en@@ l@@ y's army is flo@@ c@@ king to support St@@ ann@@ is, which would give St@@ ann@@ is su@@ peri@@ or@@ ity over us on both land and sea@@ .
I have pro@@ ved I love you.

W@@ ouldn't you be wondering what I'm think@@ ing?
What if they could talk to us?
Someone very wea@@ l@@ thy wanted me dead.
- F@@ loy@@ d, come on.
Come on, K@@ ent.
He said my father offic@@ i@@ ated as a pri@@ est in his hou@@ se@@ hol@@ d.
It's the moment of tru@@ th, bo@@ ys, so keep your eyes pe@@ el@@ ed.
Mo@@ tt@@ s!
I'd not be surpri@@ sed if he thinks so too. - Why would he dec@@ eive us?
We've been trying to reach you, son.
A few p@@ ounds of sa@@ mpl@@ es, but what do you expec@@ t?
As an an@@ ti@@ -@@ capit@@ ali@@ st, it would be hy@@ po@@ cr@@ iti@@ cal to start selling people tea@@ .
(@@ F@@ R@@ AN@@ CK SI@@ GH@@ S)
That thing's heading your way.
We appreciate it.
Our do@@ gs will be us@@ ed!

D@@ ang it.
D@@ ang it!
Is that so?
Check this.
I'll take that.
This way!
Don't hurt him.
Rom@@ i@@ lly did not survi@@ ve.
Most of the men on this ship can't rea@@ d.
I only hope you're ready to face the fire@@ !
I'm so mad about you...
Just that everyone would no@@ tice how strang@@ e A@@ lice is.
If it do@@ es@@ n@@ '@@ t, it's even better.
It'll lead to some@@ body.
Yeah, but it's better than life in the tow@@ n@@ s.
Her@@ c@@ !
I've been really busy at the ac@@ a@@ dem@@ y.
3@@ . 2. 1.
Let me introduc@@ e you to a new memb@@ er.
Why is this B@@ ear M@@ oun@@ tain Ro@@ ad do@@ tt@@ ed like this?
And how much bloo@@ d?
In the mea@@ dow of the mountain in the w@@ est, I saw it happen.
Yeah, they@@ 'd love that, mate.
Hello, Sp@@ it@@ el@@ out.
Can you pl@@ u@@ g that hole with D@@ r@@ one 10@@ 9@@ ?
- Sh@@ ort@@ est meeting I can remember.
You too, you're a ca@@ de@@ t.
W@@ ha@@ ts coming to you.
I know, but you will be 1@@ 9 this su@@ mm@@ er and the girls already say you don't like them.
U@@ gh@@ !
He@@ 'd never hurt me.
You strike me as a partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly ic@@ y and re@@ mor@@ sel@@ ess man, Mr. Dufres@@ ne.
Then tell them to turn aroun@@ d!
[@@ man laugh@@ ing] woman speaking native language: There is a new one over here.
Why are there humans here, Mor@@ o?
( brea@@ thes dee@@ p@@ ly )
Ma@@ di@@ , where does it hur@@ t?
They do.
A@@ x@@ e, go with P@@ eng@@ ell@@ y.
Just like my P@@ o.
- Who said that?
It doesn't matter to me.
Every@@ thing's changed for me about the fut@@ ure.
And that this needs ice.
-@@ All right
[@@ Rememb@@ er@@ ing@@ :
Oh, no, I go@@ t...
It's like this you se@@ e...
I'll have a mou@@ th@@ ful.
Willi@@ am, I take it?
Mom, are you in there?
- To get the sou@@ p.
-@@ Where's he going?
Did you know that the president travel@@ s in an 1@@ 8@@ ton milit@@ ar@@ y@@ arm@@ ou@@ re@@ d@@ ..
The other problem then?
Like I said in pri@@ son, a man will do anything to keep his mind oc@@ cup@@ i@@ ed.
You're very luck@@ y, Miss H@@ at@@ to.
Something that big@@ ? I need the situ@@ ation, the ang@@ er...
I'm completely fine.
We got to let her sli@@ de as far as we can.
I'll watch her.
Something the mat@@ ter?
They form@@ ed quite an att@@ ach@@ ment.
But, rea@@ lly, you're just a d@@ enti@@ st.
How about a round of app@@ la@@ us@@ e?
I want Har@@ sha@@ .
You guys, never under@@ es@@ tim@@ ate the power of a Dra@@ m@@ atic En@@ tr@@ ance.
My old man, he seems to like you,
Let me give Mad@@ i his medic@@ ine
Still your secre@@ ts.
I can go so there and kill something.
Do you feel that's good enough@@ ?
Hey! - Sto@@ p!
So, what do you have for me, 00@@ 7@@ ?
I shall pas@@ s, thank you kin@@ d@@ ly.
What's it supposed to do?
Open his shir@@ t.
They're for you, I bought them at the mar@@ ket.
D@@ an, did you get tired of bom@@ b@@ ing the uni@@ ver@@ se?
I smell a rat@@ .
He said he'll stay here for 2 days.
- You nerv@@ ou@@ s?
Lou@@ is L@@ '@@ A@@ mou@@ r.
You're always that gu@@ y, John.
I can bring him back, I just... need a large enough sac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice.
He left us here to die.
Do you want me?
He's got my bicy@@ c@@ le!
I really apologi@@ z@@ e...
And a little terri@@ fied and really excit@@ ed.
It's so ab@@ sur@@ d.

B@@ rav@@ o 1@@ 4@@ , open peri@@ me@@ ter f@@ ence.
- Na@@ h, she's all right.
I'm not a master of chi@@ , okay?
They're a@@ da@@ p@@ ting.
Not norma@@ l, b@@ ru@@ v@@ .
And maybe she's heard from Doug.
That's a fac@@ t.
To me, it's just a ma@@ de@@ -@@ up word.
it has changed to@@ ta@@ ll@@ y... imagin@@ ations of the past have become wi@@ sh@@ es to reach you... I'm seeing you every@@ w@@ here...
How are you da@@ d?
This was my father's cop@@ y.
Did we shoot some@@ bod@@ y?
It's Satur@@ day again.
Give him the sign@@ al.
It was crazy. Att@@ abo@@ y.
What the hell they tal@@ kin' to me like that for?
We don't know our position.
That's Ayou@@ b over there. My big brother
FUCK@@ ING@@ ...

I knew who it was.
Why don't you?

Hey, Dad, could I have a wor@@ d?
You can sp@@ are five minutes.
You got to take it, Al@@ fre@@ d.
All of a sudd@@ en, it's not grav@@ ity holding you to the planet.

That will be the coo@@ k.
I@@ deal for ground and air tran@@ sp@@ ort.
"@@ Some@@ day it will kill me@@ ."
Every@@ one, go get your thing@@ s!
I swear to God.
So go ahead.
Any@@ body want some gr@@ an@@ it@@ e?
You g@@ ag@@ g@@ le of gu@@ t@@ less use of the w@@ ound@@ ..
The ne@@ ural sur@@ ge would be too much for the human bra@@ in.
Do you think it could be pas@@ se@@ d?
See over there?
Did they hur@@ l you? You know they can't.
Be@@ tter make sure you get her a big ro@@ ck, man, 'cause she doesn't look like she'll be that easi@@ ly impres@@ sed.
- I thought you fell off a hor@@ se.
Go on. Have away.
Well the win@@ ters can be fan@@ tast@@ i@@ cally cru@@ el.
You be careful.
Let's go, hand@@ s@@ ome.
Go and get the yea@@ st.
Is that a g@@ as lin@@ e?
Most of it good.
He wi@@ lled a sit to her.
It had to be him.
Some say it was for all@@ i@@ ance with the tri@@ b@@ es.
How could I fit a million in here?

Yes, you'll know the pain of trea@@ son.
Any hold up today?
Did you hit the fla@@ p?
Where did they come from?
Are you gonna say anything?
Don't touch him.
That's why we call it a black hole.
There's a sh@@ ining le@@ m@@ on in the gro@@ ve near b@@ y...
Bar@@ bar@@ a?
Bla@@ h, bla@@ h, bla@@ h...
Sir, he's no ro@@ ad@@ -@@ side ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh.
Good luc@@ k, Comman@@ der.
She's right.
Can somebody at least bring me some wat@@ er?
What br@@ ings you to Chungha@@ e?
Bring him to me in 30 minut@@ es!
You only have eight minutes left to get them out.
You're really taking Car@@ ver@@ ? I mean, he shot one of them.
So where are they at?
The ca@@ libr@@ ation is very sen@@ s@@ iti@@ ve.
I'll p@@ our the water on you.
We're seeing the same thing.
That's really important to me.
S@@ mi@@ ley always tried to get something to gro@@ w.
Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly you're 5@@ 0.

I read in New@@ swee@@ k how ec@@ on@@ om@@ i@@ cally de@@ pres@@ sed plac@@ es... are like b@@ re@@ ed@@ ing gr@@ ounds for all kin@@ ds of apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic vi@@ sion@@ ari@@ es.
We can get it.
Don't con@@ des@@ c@@ end to me, K@@ at@@ o.

Benchmark Settings
Benchmarking involves measuring the transfer rate on various area of the device as well as measuring how long it takes to seek from one random area to another . Please back up important data before using the write benchmark .
Transfer Rate
Benchmarking the write-rate of a disk requires exclusive access to the disk ( e.g. the disk or its partitions cannot be mounted or in use ) and involves reading data and then writing it back . As a result , the contents of the disk is not changed . If not checked , the write-part of the benchmark will not be done but on the other hand exclusive access to the device is not needed ( e.g. the disk or device can be in use ) .
Number of samples . Bigger number produces a more accurate picture of access time patterns but takes more time .
Access Time
Number of samples . Bigger number produces more smooth graphs but the benchmark will take more time .

Name to identify panel
This is a human readable name which you can use to identify a panel . Its main purpose is to serve as the panel 's window title which is useful when navigating between panels .
With a multi-screen setup , you may have panels on each individual screen . This key identifies the current screen the panel is displayed on .
Xinerama monitor where the panel is displayed
In a Xinerama setup , you may have panels on each individual monitor . This key identifies the current monitor the panel is displayed on .
Expand to occupy entire screen width
If true , the panel will occupy the entire screen width ( height if this is a vertical panel ) . In this mode the panel can only be placed at a screen edge . If false , the panel will only be large enough to accommodate the applets , launchers and buttons on the panel .
Panel orientation
The orientation of the panel . Possible values are " top " , " bottom " , " left " , " right " . In expanded mode the key specifies which screen edge the panel is on . In un-expanded mode the difference between " top " and " bottom " is less important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel - but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects should behave . For example , on a " top " panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel , whereas on a " bottom " panel the menu will be popped up above the panel .
Panel size
The height ( width for a vertical panel ) of the panel . The panel will determine at runtime a minimum size based on the font size and other indicators . The maximum size is fixed at one quarter of the screen height ( or width ) .
Automatically hide panel into corner
If true , the panel is automatically hidden into a corner of the screen when the pointer leaves the panel area . Moving the pointer to that corner again will cause the panel to re-appear .
Enable hide buttons
If true , buttons will be placed on each side of the panel which may be used to move the panel to edge of the screen , leaving only a button showing .
Enable arrows on hide buttons
If true , arrows will be placed on the hide buttons . This key is only relevant if the enable _ buttons key is true .

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection?

Do you really want to add "%s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windows™. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.
Should files be renamed to be fully Windows-compatible?
Those names should be changed and truncated to 64 characters.

Plugins
Automatic orientation
Whether the image should be rotated automatically based on EXIF orientation.
The color that is used to fill the area behind the image. If the use-background-color key is not set, the color is determined by the active GTK+ theme instead.
Interpolate Image
Whether the image should be interpolated on zoom-out. This leads to better quality but is somewhat slower than non-interpolated images.
Extrapolate Image
Whether the image should be extrapolated on zoom-in. This leads to blurry quality and is somewhat slower than non-extrapolated images.
Transparency indicator
Determines how transparency should be indicated. Valid values are CHECK_PATTERN, COLOR and NONE. If COLOR is chosen, then the trans-color key determines the color value used.
Scroll wheel zoom
Whether the scroll wheel should be used for zooming.
Zoom multiplier
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming. This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event. For example, 0.05 results in a 5% zoom increment for each scroll event and 1.00 result in a 100% zoom increment.
Transparency color
If the transparency key has the value COLOR, then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency.
Use a custom background color
If this is active, the color set by the background-color key will be used to fill the area behind the image. If it is not set, the current GTK+ theme will determine the fill color.
Loop through the image sequence
Whether the sequence of images should be shown in an endless loop.
Allow zoom greater than 100% initially
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially.
Delay in seconds until showing the next image
A value greater than 0 determines the seconds an image stays on screen until the next one is shown automatically. Zero disables the automatic browsing.
Show/Hide the window toolbar.
Show/Hide the window statusbar.
Show/Hide the image gallery pane.
Image gallery pane position. Set to 0 for bottom; 1 for left; 2 for top; 3 for right.
Whether the image gallery pane should be resizable.
Show/Hide the window side pane.
Show/Hide the image gallery pane scroll buttons.
Close main window without asking to save changes.
Trash images without asking
If activated, Eye of GNOME won't ask for confirmation when moving images to the trash. It will still ask if any of the files cannot be moved to the trash and would be deleted instead.
Whether the file chooser should show the user's pictures folder if no images are loaded.
If activated and no image is loaded in the active window, the file chooser will display the user's pictures folder using the XDG special user directories. If deactivated or the pictures folder has not been set up, it will show the current working directory.
Whether the metadata list in the properties dialog should have its own page.
If activated, the detailed metadata list in the properties dialog will be moved to its own page in the dialog. This should make the dialog more usable on smaller screens, e.g. as used by netbooks. If disabled, the widget will be embedded on the "Metadata" page.
External program to use for editing images
The desktop file name (including the ".desktop") of the application to use for editing images (when the "Edit Image" toolbar button is clicked). Set to the empty string to disable this feature.

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

Calculates the present value of an investment based on a series of equal payments discounted at a periodic interest rate over the number of payment periods in the term.
Periodic Interest Rate
Calculates the periodic interest necessary to increase an investment to a future value, over the number of compounding periods.
Straight-Line Depreciation
_Cost:
_Salvage:
Calculates the straight-line depreciation of an asset for one period. The straight-line method of depreciation divides the depreciable cost evenly over the useful life of an asset. The useful life is the number of periods, typically years, over which an asset is depreciated.
Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits Depreciation
Calculates the depreciation allowance on an asset for a specified period of time, using the Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits method. This method of depreciation accelerates the rate of depreciation, so that more depreciation expense occurs in earlier periods than in later ones. The useful life is the number of periods, typically years, over which an asset is depreciated.
Payment Period
Future _Value:
Calculates the number of payment periods that are necessary during the term of an ordinary annuity, to accumulate a future value, at a periodic interest rate.

The '/' name can only be a directory, not a key
Value for `%s' set in a read-only source at the front of your configuration path
Unable to store a value at key '%s', as the configuration server has no writable databases. There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file %s/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped. If you have two gconfd processes (or had two at the time the second was launched), logging out, killing all copies of gconfd, and logging back in may help. If you have stale locks, remove ~/.gconf*/*lock. Perhaps the problem is that you attempted to use GConf from two machines at once, and ORBit still has its default configuration that prevents remote CORBA connections - put "ORBIIOPIPv4=1" in /etc/orbitrc. As always, check the user.* syslog for details on problems gconfd encountered. There can only be one gconfd per home directory, and it must own a lockfile in ~/.gconfd and also lockfiles in individual storage locations such as ~/.gconf

Calculates the amount of the periodic payment of a loan, where payments are made at the end of each payment period.
_Principal:
_Term:
Present Value
Calculates the present value of an investment based on a series of equal payments discounted at a periodic interest rate over the number of payment periods in the term.
Periodic Interest Rate
Calculates the periodic interest necessary to increase an investment to a future value, over the number of compounding periods.
Straight-Line Depreciation
_Cost:
_Salvage:
Calculates the straight-line depreciation of an asset for one period. The straight-line method of depreciation divides the depreciable cost evenly over the useful life of an asset. The useful life is the number of periods, typically years, over which an asset is depreciated.
Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits Depreciation
Calculates the depreciation allowance on an asset for a specified period of time, using the Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits method. This method of depreciation accelerates the rate of depreciation, so that more depreciation expense occurs in earlier periods than in later ones. The useful life is the number of periods, typically years, over which an asset is depreciated.
Payment Period
Future _Value:
Calculates the number of payment periods that are necessary during the term of an ordinary annuity, to accumulate a future value, at a periodic interest rate.

Display information on this GNOME version
GNOME is a Free, usable, stable, accessible desktop environment for the Unix-like family of operating systems.
GNOME includes most of what you see on your computer, including the file manager, web browser, menus, and many applications.
GNOME also includes a complete development platform for applications programmers, allowing the creation of powerful and complex applications.
GNOME's focus on usability and accessibility, regular release cycle, and strong corporate backing make it unique among Free Software desktops.
GNOME's greatest strength is our strong community. Virtually anyone, with or without coding skills, can contribute to making GNOME better.
Hundreds of people have contributed code to GNOME since it was started in 1997; many more have contributed in other important ways, including translations, documentation, and quality assurance.

_Start Benchmarking…
Benchmarking involves measuring the transfer rate on various area of the device as well as measuring how long it takes to seek from one random area to another. Please back up important data before using the write benchmark.
Transfer Rate
Number of S_amples
Sample S_ize (MiB)
Perform _write-benchmark
Benchmarking the write-rate of a disk requires exclusive access to the disk (e.g. the disk or its partitions cannot be mounted or in use) and involves reading data and then writing it back. As a result, the contents of the disk is not changed. If not checked, the write-part of the benchmark will not be done but on the other hand exclusive access to the device is not needed (e.g. the disk or device can be in use).
Number of samples. Bigger number produces a more accurate picture of access time patterns but takes more time.
The number of MiB (1048576 bytes) to read/write for each sample. Big sample sizes tend to produce more accurate benchmarks at the cost of the benchmark taking more time.
Access Time
Number of Sampl_es
Number of samples. Bigger number produces more smooth graphs but the benchmark will take more time.

The location of the image file used as the icon for the object's button. If empty, the default icon for the menu will be used.
Menu content path
The path from which the menu contents is contructed. If empty, the menu will be the default applications menu.
Object IID
The implementation ID of the object - e.g. "ClockAppletFactory::ClockApplet".
Toplevel panel containing object
The identifier of the toplevel panel which contains this object.
Interpret position relative to bottom/right edge
If set to 'end', the position of the object is interpreted relative to the right (or bottom if vertical) edge of the panel.
Object's position on the panel
The position of this panel object. The position is specified by the number of pixels from the left (or top if vertical) panel edge.
Name to identify panel
This is a human readable name which you can use to identify a panel. Its main purpose is to serve as the panel's window title which is useful when navigating between panels.
X screen where the panel is displayed
With a multi-screen setup, you may have panels on each individual screen. This key identifies the current screen the panel is displayed on.
Xinerama monitor where the panel is displayed
In a Xinerama setup, you may have panels on each individual monitor. This key identifies the current monitor the panel is displayed on.
Expand to occupy entire screen width
If true, the panel will occupy the entire screen width (height if this is a vertical panel). In this mode the panel can only be placed at a screen edge. If false, the panel will only be large enough to accommodate the applets, launchers and buttons on the panel.
Panel orientation
The orientation of the panel. Possible values are "top", "bottom", "left", "right". In expanded mode the key specifies which screen edge the panel is on. In un-expanded mode the difference between "top" and "bottom" is less important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel - but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects should behave. For example, on a "top" panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel, whereas on a "bottom" panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.
Panel size
The height (width for a vertical panel) of the panel. The panel will determine at runtime a minimum size based on the font size and other indicators. The maximum size is fixed at one quarter of the screen height (or width).
X co-ordinate of panel
The location of the panel along the x-axis. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
Y co-ordinate of panel
The location of the panel along the y-axis. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
X co-ordinate of panel, starting from the right of the screen
The location of the panel along the x-axis, starting from the right of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the x key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the x key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
Y co-ordinate of panel, starting from the bottom of the screen
The location of the panel along the y-axis, starting from the bottom of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the y key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the y key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
Center panel on x-axis
If true, the x and x_right keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the x-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the x and x_right keys specify the location of the panel.
Center panel on y-axis
If true, the y and y_bottom keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the y-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the y and y_bottom keys specify the location of the panel.
Automatically hide panel into corner
If true, the panel is automatically hidden into a corner of the screen when the pointer leaves the panel area. Moving the pointer to that corner again will cause the panel to re-appear.
Enable hide buttons
If true, buttons will be placed on each side of the panel which may be used to move the panel to edge of the screen, leaving only a button showing.
Enable arrows on hide buttons
If true, arrows will be placed on the hide buttons. This key is only relevant if the enable_buttons key is true.
Panel autohide delay
Specifies the number of milliseconds delay after the pointer leaves the panel area before the panel is automatically hidden. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Panel autounhide delay
Specifies the number of milliseconds delay after the pointer enters the panel area before the panel is automatically re-shown. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Visible pixels when hidden
Specifies the number of pixels visible when the panel is automatically hidden into a corner. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Animation speed
The speed in which panel animations should occur. Possible values are "slow", "medium" and "fast". This key is only relevant if the enable_animations key is true.
Background type
Which type of background should be used for this panel. Possible values are "none" - the default GTK+ widget background will be used, "color" - the color key will be used as background color or "image" - the image specified by the image key will be used as background.
Background color
Specifies the background color for the panel in #RGB format.
Background image
Specifies the file to be used for the background image. If the image contains an alpha channel it will be composited onto the desktop background image.
Rotate image on vertical panels
If true, the background image will be rotated when the panel is oriented vertically.
Image options
Determines how the image set by image-uri is rendered. Possible values are "none", "stretch", "fit". With "stretch", the image will be scaled to the panel dimensions and the aspect ratio of the image will not be maintained. With "fit", the image will be scaled (retaining the aspect ratio of the image) to the panel height (if horizontal).

'clone' will display the same thing on all monitors, 'dock' will switch off the internal monitor, 'do-nothing' will use the default Xorg behaviour (extend the desktop in recent versions). The default, 'follow-lid', will choose between 'do-nothing' and 'dock' depending on whether the lid is (respectively) open or closed.
Antialiasing
The type of antialiasing to use when rendering fonts. Possible values are: "none" for no antialiasing, "grayscale" for standard grayscale antialiasing, and "rgba" for subpixel antialiasing (LCD screens only).
Hinting
The type of hinting to use when rendering fonts. Possible values are: "none" for no hinting, "slight" for basic, "medium" for moderate, and "full" for maximum hinting (may cause distortion of letter forms).
RGBA order
The order of subpixel elements on an LCD screen; only used when antialiasing is set to "rgba". Possible values are: "rgb" for red on left (most common), "bgr" for blue on left, "vrgb" for red on top, "vbgr" for red on bottom.
List of explicitly disabled GTK+ modules
A list of strings representing the GTK+ modules that will not be loaded, even if enabled by default in their configuration.

List of profiles
List of profiles known to gnome-terminal. The list contains strings naming subdirectories relative to /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles.
Profile to use for new terminals
Profile to be used when opening a new window or tab. Must be in profile_list.
Whether the menubar has access keys
Whether to have Alt+letter access keys for the menubar. They may interfere with some applications run inside the terminal so it's possible to turn them off.
Whether the standard GTK shortcut for menubar access is enabled
Normally you can access the menubar with F10. This can also be customized via gtkrc (gtk-menu-bar-accel = "whatever"). This option allows the standard menubar accelerator to be disabled.
[UTF-8,current]
List of available encodings
A subset of possible encodings are presented in the Encoding submenu. This is a list of encodings to appear there. The special encoding name "current" means to display the encoding of the current locale.
Whether to ask for confirmation when closing terminal windows
Whether to ask for confirmation when closing a terminal window which has more than one open tab.
Default
Human-readable name of the profile
Human-readable name of the profile.
Whether to show menubar in new windows/tabs
True if the menubar should be shown in new windows, for windows/tabs with this profile.
Default color of text in the terminal
Default color of text in the terminal, as a color specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a color name such as "red").
Default color of terminal background
Default color of terminal background, as a color specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a color name such as "red").
Default color of bold text in the terminal
Default color of bold text in the terminal, as a color specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a color name such as "red"). This is ignored if bold_color_same_as_fg is true.
Whether bold text should use the same color as normal text
If true, boldface text will be rendered using the same color as normal text.
What to do with dynamic title
If the application in the terminal sets the title (most typically people have their shell set up to do this), the dynamically-set title can erase the configured title, go before it, go after it, or replace it. The possible values are "replace", "before", "after", and "ignore".
Title for terminal
Title to display for the terminal window or tab. This title may be replaced by or combined with the title set by the application inside the terminal, depending on the title_mode setting.
Whether to allow bold text
If true, allow applications in the terminal to make text boldface.
Whether to silence terminal bell
If true, don't make a noise when applications send the escape sequence for the terminal bell.
Characters that are considered "part of a word"
When selecting text by word, sequences of these characters are considered single words. Ranges can be given as "A-Z". Literal hyphen (not expressing a range) should be the first character given.
Whether to use custom terminal size for new windows
If true, newly created terminal windows will have custom size specified by default_size_columns and default_size_rows.
Default number of columns
Number of columns in newly created terminal windows. Has no effect if use_custom_default_size is not enabled.
Default number of rows
Number of rows in newly created terminal windows. Has no effect if use_custom_default_size is not enabled.
Position of the scrollbar
Where to put the terminal scrollbar. Possibilities are "left", "right", and "hidden".
Number of lines to keep in scrollback
Number of scrollback lines to keep around. You can scroll back in the terminal by this number of lines; lines that don't fit in the scrollback are discarded. If scrollback_unlimited is true, this value is ignored.
Whether an unlimited number of lines should be kept in scrollback
If true, scrollback lines will never be discarded. The scrollback history is stored on disk temporarily, so this may cause the system to run out of disk space if there is a lot of output to the terminal.
Whether to scroll to the bottom when a key is pressed
If true, pressing a key jumps the scrollbar to the bottom.
Whether to scroll to the bottom when there's new output
If true, whenever there's new output the terminal will scroll to the bottom.
What to do with the terminal when the child command exits
Possible values are "close" to close the terminal, and "restart" to restart the command.
Whether to launch the command in the terminal as a login shell
If true, the command inside the terminal will be launched as a login shell. (argv[0] will have a hyphen in front of it.)
Whether to update login records when launching terminal command
If true, the system login records utmp and wtmp will be updated when the command inside the terminal is launched.
Whether to run a custom command instead of the shell
If true, the value of the custom_command setting will be used in place of running a shell.
Whether to blink the cursor
The possible values are "system" to use the global cursor blinking settings, or "on" or "off" to set the mode explicitly.
The cursor appearance
The possible values are "block" to use a block cursor, "ibeam" to use a vertical line cursor, or "underline" to use an underline cursor.
Custom command to use instead of the shell
Run this command in place of the shell, if use_custom_command is true.
Icon for terminal window
Icon to use for tabs/windows containing this profile.
Palette for terminal applications
Terminals have a 16-color palette that applications inside the terminal can use. This is that palette, in the form of a colon-separated list of color names. Color names should be in hex format e.g. "#FF00FF"
Font
An Pango font name. Examples are "Sans 12" or "Monospace Bold 14".
Background type
Type of terminal background. May be "solid" for a solid color, "image" for an image, or "transparent" for either real transparency if a compositing window manager is running, or pseudo-transparency otherwise.
Background image
Filename of a background image.
Whether to scroll background image
If true, scroll the background image with the foreground text; if false, keep the image in a fixed position and scroll the text above it.
How much to darken the background image
A value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how much to darken the background image. 0.0 means no darkness, 1.0 means fully dark. In the current implementation, there are only two levels of darkness possible, so the setting behaves as a boolean, where 0.0 disables the darkening effect.
Effect of the Backspace key
Sets what code the backspace key generates. Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "ascii-del" is normally considered the correct setting for the Backspace key.
Effect of the Delete key
Sets what code the delete key generates. Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "escape-sequence" is normally considered the correct setting for the Delete key.
Whether to use the colors from the theme for the terminal widget
If true, the theme color scheme used for text entry boxes will be used for the terminal, instead of colors provided by the user.
Whether to use the system font
If true, the terminal will use the desktop-global standard font if it's monospace (and the most similar font it can come up with otherwise).
current
Default encoding
Default encoding. Can be either "current" to use the current locale's encoding, or else any of the known encodings.
Keyboard shortcut to open a new tab
Keyboard shortcut key for opening a new tab. Expressed as a string in the same format used for GTK+ resource files. If you set the option to the special string "disabled", then there will be no keyboard shortcut for this action.
Keyboard shortcut to open a new window

Character map grouping method
This is how the characters in the character map are grouped. The characters can either be grouped by 'script' or 'block'.
Character map font description
The font to use for the character map. If set to 'nothing' then the default is the system font with the size doubled. Otherwise it should be a font description string like 'Sans 24'.
Snap number of columns to a power of two
The number of columns in the character map grid is determined by the width of the window. If this setting is 'true' then the value will be forced to the nearest power of two.
Last selected character
This is the last character that was selected in the character map (and will be selected again when the character map is next started). By default, it is the first letter of the alphabet in the current locale.

Weather data from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute
URL for the radar map
The custom URL from where to retrieve a radar map, or empty for disabling radar maps.
Temperature unit
The unit of temperature used for showing weather. Valid values are 'kelvin', 'centigrade' and 'fahrenheit'.
Distance unit
The unit of distance used for showing weather (for example for visibility or for distance of important events). Valid values are 'meters', 'km' and 'miles'.
Speed unit
The unit of speed used for showing weather (for example for wind speed). Valid values are 'ms' (meters per second), 'kph' (kilometers per hour), 'mph' (miles per hour), 'knots' and 'bft' (Beaufort scale).
Pressure unit
The unit of pressure used for showing weather. Valid values are 'kpa' (kilopascal), 'hpa' (hectopascal), 'mb' (millibar, mathematically equivalent to 1 hPa but shown differently), 'mm-hg' (millimiters of mercury), 'inch-hg' (inches of mercury), 'atm' (atmospheres).
Default location
The default location for the weather applet. The first field is the name that will be shown. If empty, it will be taken from the locations database. The second field is the METAR code for the default weather station. It must not be empty and must correspond to a &lt;codegt; tag in the Locations.xml file. The third field is a tuple of (latitude, longitude), to override the value taken from the database. This is only used for sunrise and moon phase calculations, not for weather forecast.

Compositing Manager
Determines whether Metacity is a compositing manager.
If true, trade off usability for less resource usage
If true, metacity will give the user less feedback by using wireframes, avoiding animations, or other means. This is a significant reduction in usability for many users, but may allow legacy applications to continue working, and may also be a useful tradeoff for terminal servers. However, the wireframe feature is disabled when accessibility is on.

Search
Search for “%s”
Unable to complete the requested search
Where to position newly open tabs in browser windows.
If set to "after-current-tab", then new tabs are inserted after the current tab. If set to "end", then new tabs are appended to the end of the tab list.
Always use the location entry, instead of the pathbar
If set to true, then Nautilus browser windows will always use a textual input entry for the location toolbar, instead of the pathbar.
Whether to ask for confirmation when deleting files, or emptying Trash
If set to true, then Nautilus will ask for confirmation when you attempt to delete files, or empty the Trash.
Whether to enable immediate deletion
If set to true, then Nautilus will have a feature allowing you to delete a file immediately and in-place, instead of moving it to the trash. This feature can be dangerous, so use caution.
When to show number of items in a folder
Speed tradeoff for when to show the number of items in a folder. If set to "always" then always show item counts, even if the folder is on a remote server. If set to "local-only" then only show counts for local file systems. If set to "never" then never bother to compute item counts.
Type of click used to launch/open files
Possible values are "single" to launch files on a single click, or "double" to launch them on a double click.
What to do with executable text files when activated
What to do with executable text files when they are activated (single or double clicked). Possible values are "launch" to launch them as programs, "ask" to ask what to do via a dialog, and "display" to display them as text files.
Show the package installer for unknown mime types
Whether to show the user a package installer dialog in case an unknown mime type is opened, in order to search for an application to handle it.
Use extra mouse button events in Nautilus' browser window
For users with mice that have "Forward" and "Back" buttons, this key will determine if any action is taken inside of Nautilus when either is pressed.
Mouse button to activate the "Forward" command in browser window
For users with mice that have buttons for "Forward" and "Back", this key will set which button activates the "Forward" command in a browser window. Possible values range between 6 and 14.
Mouse button to activate the "Back" command in browser window
For users with mice that have buttons for "Forward" and "Back", this key will set which button activates the "Back" command in a browser window. Possible values range between 6 and 14.
When to show thumbnails of files
Speed tradeoff for when to show a file as a thumbnail. If set to "always" then always thumbnail, even if the folder is on a remote server. If set to "local-only" then only show thumbnails for local file systems. If set to "never" then never bother to thumbnail files, just use a generic icon. Despite what the name may suggest, this applies to any previewable file type.
Maximum image size for thumbnailing
Images over this size (in bytes) won't be thumbnailed. The purpose of this setting is to avoid thumbnailing large images that may take a long time to load or use lots of memory.
Show folders first in windows
If set to true, then Nautilus shows folders prior to showing files in the icon and list views.
Default sort order
The default sort-order for items in the icon view. Possible values are "name", "size", "type" and "mtime".
Reverse sort order in new windows
If true, files in new windows will be sorted in reverse order. ie, if sorted by name, then instead of sorting the files from "a" to "z", they will be sorted from "z" to "a"; if sorted by size, instead of being incrementally they will be sorted decrementally.
Default folder viewer
When a folder is visited this viewer is used unless you have selected another view for that particular folder. Possible values are "list-view", and "icon-view".
Whether to show hidden files
This key is deprecated and ignored. The "show-hidden" key from "org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser" is now used instead.
Bulk rename utility
If set, Nautilus will append URIs of selected files and treat the result as a command line for bulk renaming. Bulk rename applications can register themselves in this key by setting the key to a space-separated string of their executable name and any command line options. If the executable name is not set to a full path, it will be searched for in the search path.
List of possible captions on icons
A list of captions below an icon in the icon view and the desktop. The actual number of captions shown depends on the zoom level. Some possible values are: "size", "type", "date_modified", "owner", "group", "permissions", and "mime_type".
Default icon zoom level
Default zoom level used by the icon view.
Default Thumbnail Icon Size
The default size of an icon for a thumbnail in the icon view.
Text Ellipsis Limit
A string specifying how parts of overlong file names should be replaced by ellipses, depending on the zoom level. Each of the list entries is of the form "Zoom Level:Integer". For each specified zoom level, if the given integer is larger than 0, the file name will not exceed the given number of lines. If the integer is 0 or smaller, no limit is imposed on the specified zoom level. A default entry of the form "Integer" without any specified zoom level is also allowed. It defines the maximum number of lines for all other zoom levels. Examples: 0 - always display overlong file names; 3 - shorten file names if they exceed three lines; smallest:5,smaller:4,0 - shorten file names if they exceed five lines for zoom level "smallest". Shorten file names if they exceed four lines for zoom level "smaller". Do not shorten file names for other zoom levels. Available zoom levels: smallest (33%), smaller (50%), small (66%), standard (100%), large (150%), larger (200%), largest (400%)

Very Carefully: Select this only if you are absolutely sure that this key is genuine.
You could use a hard to forge photo identification (such as a passport) to personally check that the name on the key is correct. You should have also used email to check that the email address belongs to the owner.

RAID Options
Software RAID allows you to combine several disks into a larger RAID device. A RAID device can be configured to provide additional speed and reliability compared to using an individual drive. For more information on using RAID devices please consult the kickstart documentation.
To use RAID you must first create at least two partitions of type 'software RAID'. Then you can create a RAID device which can be formatted and mounted.
Choose one of the following options:
Create a software RAID partition

Provide PPD file
Search for a printer driver to download
The foomatic printer database contains various manufacturer provided PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files and also can generate PPD files for a large number of (non PostScript) printers. But in general manufacturer provided PPD files provide better access to the specific features of the printer.
PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files can often be found on the driver disk that comes with the printer. For PostScript printers they are often part of the Windows® driver.

Try to transfer the current settings
Use the new PPD (Postscript Printer Description) as is.
This way all current option settings will be lost. The default settings of the new PPD will be used.
Try to copy the option settings over from the old PPD.
This is done by assuming that options with the same name do have the same meaning. Settings of options that are not present in the new PPD will be lost and options only present in the new PPD will be set to default.

Enable remote access to the desktop
If true, allows remote access to the desktop via the RFB protocol. Users on remote machines may then connect to the desktop using a VNC viewer.
Prompt the user before completing a connection
If true, remote users accessing the desktop are not allowed access until the user on the host machine approves the connection. Recommended especially when access is not password protected.
Only allow remote users to view the desktop
If true, remote users accessing the desktop are only allowed to view the desktop. Remote users will not be able to use the mouse or keyboard.
Network interface for listening
If not set, the server will listen on all network interfaces. Set this if you want to accept connections only from some specific network interface. For example, eth0, wifi0, lo and so on.
Listen on an alternative port
If true, the server will listen on another port, instead of the default (5900). The port must be specified in the 'alternative-port' key.
Alternative port number
The port which the server will listen to if the 'use-alternative-port' key is set to true. Valid values are in the range of 5000 to 50000.
Require encryption
If true, remote users accessing the desktop are required to support encryption. It is highly recommended that you use a client which supports encryption unless the intervening network is trusted.
Allowed authentication methods
Lists the authentication methods with which remote users may access the desktop. There are two possible authentication methods; "vnc" causes the remote user to be prompted for a password (the password is specified by the vnc-password key) before connecting and "none" which allows any remote user to connect.
Password required for "vnc" authentication
The password which the remote user will be prompted for if the "vnc" authentication method is used. The password specified by the key is base64 encoded. The special value of 'keyring' (which is not valid base64) means that the password is stored in the GNOME keyring.
E-mail address to which the remote desktop URL should be sent
This key specifies the e-mail address to which the remote desktop URL should be sent if the user clicks on the URL in the Desktop Sharing preferences dialog.
Lock the screen when last user disconnect
If true, the screen will be locked after the last remote client disconnects.
When the status icon should be shown
This key controls the behavior of the status icon. There are three options: "always" - the icon will always be present; "client" - the icon will only be present when someone is connected (this is the default behavior); "never" - the icon will not be present.
Whether to disable the desktop background when a user is connected
When true, disable the desktop background and replace it with a single block of color when a user successfully connects.
Whether a UPnP router should be used to forward and open ports
If true, request that a UPnP-capable router should forward and open the port used by Vino.
Whether we should disable the XDamage extension of X.org
If true, do not use the XDamage extension of X.org. This extension does not work properly on some video drivers when using 3D effects. Disabling it will make Vino work in these environments, with slower rendering as a side effect.
Notify on connect
If true, show a notification when a user connects to the system.

XChat-GNOME Setup
Welcome to XChat-GNOME! Since this is your first time using this application, there are a couple things you'll need to configure before you can get started. These are the names by which you'll be recognized on IRC. Your nick name is the name by which you'll be known, whereas the real name is useful for things such as registering with services. You do not have to use your real name if you do not want to.

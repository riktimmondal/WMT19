The book of the generation of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham .
Abraham begat Isaac ; and Isaac begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren ;
And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar ; and Phares begat Esrom ; and Esrom begat Aram ;
And Aram begat Aminadab ; and Aminadab begat Naasson ; and Naasson begat Salmon ;
And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab ; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth ; and Obed begat Jesse ;
And Jesse begat David the king ; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias ;
And Solomon begat Roboam ; and Roboam begat Abia ; and Abia begat Asa ;
And Asa begat Josaphat ; and Josaphat begat Joram ; and Joram begat Ozias ;
And Ozias begat Joatham ; and Joatham begat Achaz ; and Achaz begat Ezekias ;
And Ezekias begat Manasses ; and Manasses begat Amon ; and Amon begat Josias ;
And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren , about the time they were carried away to Babylon :
And Zorobabel begat Abiud ; and Abiud begat Eliakim ; and Eliakim begat Azor ;
And Azor begat Sadoc ; and Sadoc begat Achim ; and Achim begat Eliud ;
And Eliud begat Eleazar ; and Eleazar begat Matthan ; and Matthan begat Jacob ;
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations .
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy Ghost .
Then Joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing to make her a publick example , was minded to put her away privily .
Now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying ,
Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife :
And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son : and he called his name JESUS .
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king , behold , there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem ,
When Herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .
Then Herod , when he had privily called the wise men , inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared .
When they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
And when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frankincense , and myrrh .
And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way .
When he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt :
Then Herod , when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem , and in all the coasts thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men .
But when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
And he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod , he was afraid to go thither : notwithstanding , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Galilee :
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets , He shall be called a Nazarene .
In those days came John the Baptist , preaching in the wilderness of Judaea ,
And the same John had his raiment of camel 's hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his meat was locusts and wild honey .
Then went out to him Jerusalem , and all Judaea , and all the region round about Jordan ,
And were baptized of him in Jordan , confessing their sins .
Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance :
And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John , to be baptized of him .
And Jesus , when he was baptized , went up straightway out of the water : and , lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him :
Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil .
And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was afterward an hungred .
Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city , and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple ,
Again , the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain , and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ;
Then the devil leaveth him , and , behold , angels came and ministered unto him .
Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison , he departed into Galilee ;
And leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim :
And Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
And they straightway left their nets , and followed him .
And going on from thence , he saw other two brethren , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in a ship with Zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them .
And they immediately left the ship and their father , and followed him .
And Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people .
And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee , and from Decapolis , and from Jerusalem , and from Judaea , and from beyond Jordan .
And seeing the multitudes , he went up into a mountain : and when he was set , his disciples came unto him :
Blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted .
Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth .
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .
Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy .
Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God .
Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called the children of God .
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ' sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
Rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
Neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick ; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father which is in heaven .
For verily I say unto you , Till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled .
For I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
But I say unto you , That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council : but whosoever shall say , Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire .
Leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
Verily I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing .
But I say unto you , That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
And if thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
And if thy right hand offend thee , cut if off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
But I say unto you , That whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery .
But I say unto you , Swear not at all ; neither by heaven ; for it is God 's throne :
Nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great King .
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black .
But I say unto you , That ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also .
And if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloke also .
And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile , go with him twain .
Give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
But I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ;
That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .
For if ye love them which love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ?
And if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the publicans so ?
Be ye therefore perfect , even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect .
But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
Be not ye therefore like unto them : for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done in earth , as it is in heaven .
Give us this day our daily bread .
And forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors .
For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you :
But if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thine head , and wash thy face ;
That thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal :
For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
But if thine eye be evil , thy whole body shall be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is that darkness !
Behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them . Are ye not much better than they ?
Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature ?
And yet I say unto you , That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
Wherefore , if God so clothe the grass of the field , which to day is , and to morrow is cast into the oven , shall he not much more clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
( For after all these things do the Gentiles seek : ) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
But seek ye first the kingdom of God , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
Judge not , that ye be not judged .
For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again .
Thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother 's eye .
For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
Or if he ask a fish , will he give him a serpent ?
If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
Because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it .
Ye shall know them by their fruits . Do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
Many will say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out devils ? and in thy name done many wonderful works ?
And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock .
And it came to pass , when Jesus had ended these sayings , the people were astonished at his doctrine :
For he taught them as one having authority , and not as the scribes .
When he was come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
And I say unto you , That many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven .
And when Jesus was come into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother laid , and sick of a fever .
And he touched her hand , and the fever left her : and she arose , and ministered unto them .
When the even was come , they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils : and he cast out the spirits with his word , and healed all that were sick :
Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
And when he was entered into a ship , his disciples followed him .
And , behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with devils , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding .
And they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils .
And , behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts .
And he entered into a ship , and passed over , and came into his own city .
And he arose , and departed to his house .
But when the multitudes saw it , they marvelled , and glorified God , which had given such power unto men .
And it came to pass , as Jesus sat at meat in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples .
And Jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
And , behold , a woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment :
And when Jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
But when the people were put forth , he went in , and took her by the hand , and the maid arose .
And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land .
But they , when they were departed , spread abroad his fame in all that country .
As they went out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil .
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
But when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
Simon the Canaanite , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him .
These twelve Jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not :
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils : freely ye have received , freely give .
Provide neither gold , nor silver , nor brass in your purses ,
Nor scrip for your journey , neither two coats , neither shoes , nor yet staves : for the workman is worthy of his meat .
And if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
But beware of men : for they will deliver you up to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues ;
And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the Gentiles .
But when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you .
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
But when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
What I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father .
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
Fear ye not therefore , ye are of more value than many sparrows .
But whosoever shall deny me before men , him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven .
He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
And he that taketh not his cross , and followeth after me , is not worthy of me .
He that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet 's reward ; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man 's reward .
And it came to pass , when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities .
Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ , he sent two of his disciples ,
But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
But what went ye out for to see ? A prophet ? yea , I say unto you , and more than a prophet .
Verily I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist : notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force .
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John .
And if ye will receive it , this is Elias , which was for to come .
He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done , because they repented not :
But I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment , than for you .
Even so , Father : for so it seemed good in thy sight .
All things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him .
Take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn ; and his disciples were an hungred , and began to pluck the ears of corn , and to eat .
How he entered into the house of God , and did eat the shewbread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the priests ?
Or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
But I say unto you , That in this place is one greater than the temple .
And when he was departed thence , he went into their synagogue :
Then the Pharisees went out , and held a council against him , how they might destroy him .
But when Jesus knew it , he withdrew himself from thence : and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them all ;
And charged them that they should not make him known :
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying ,
Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
And if Satan cast out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how shall then his kingdom stand ?
And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ? therefore they shall be your judges .
But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is come unto you .
Or else how can one enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house .
He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad .
And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things : and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
But I say unto you , That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale 's belly ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
While he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him .
The same day went Jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
And great multitudes were gathered together unto him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
And when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up :
Some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth :
And when the sun was up , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprung up , and choked them :
But other fell into good ground , and brought forth fruit , some an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , some thirtyfold .
For whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath .
Therefore speak I to them in parables : because they seeing see not ; and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand .
But blessed are your eyes , for they see : and your ears , for they hear .
For verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
Yet hath he not root in himself , but dureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , by and by he is offended .
But while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat , and went his way .
But when the blade was sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
Which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables ; and without a parable spake he not unto them :
The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ;
The enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ;
And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
Who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
Which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
So shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just ,
And it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence .
Is not this the carpenter 's son ? is not his mother called Mary ? and his brethren , James , and Joses , and Simon , and Judas ?
And his sisters , are they not all with us ? Whence then hath this man all these things ?
And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief .
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus ,
For Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife .
And when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
But when Herod 's birthday was kept , the daughter of Herodias danced before them , and pleased Herod .
Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask .
And the king was sorry : nevertheless for the oath 's sake , and them which sat with him at meat , he commanded it to be given her .
And he sent , and beheaded John in the prison .
And his head was brought in a charger , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
And his disciples came , and took up the body , and buried it , and went and told Jesus .
When Jesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
And Jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and he healed their sick .
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass , and took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake , and gave the loaves to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
And they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full .
And they that had eaten were about five thousand men , beside women and children .
And when he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into a mountain apart to pray : and when the evening was come , he was there alone .
But the ship was now in the midst of the sea , tossed with waves : for the wind was contrary .
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them , walking on the sea .
And when they were come into the ship , the wind ceased .
And when they were gone over , they came into the land of Gennesaret .
And when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought unto him all that were diseased ;
And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfectly whole .
Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees , which were of Jerusalem , saying ,
And honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition .
Do not ye yet understand , that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart ; and they defile the man .
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies :
Then Jesus went thence , and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon .
And Jesus departed from thence , and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee ; and went up into a mountain , and sat down there .
And great multitudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
Insomuch that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb to speak , the maimed to be whole , the lame to walk , and the blind to see : and they glorified the God of Israel .
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground .
And he took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and brake them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
And they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full .
And they that did eat were four thousand men , beside women and children .
And he sent away the multitude , and took ship , and came into the coasts of Magdala ,
The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came , and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven .
And in the morning , It will be foul weather to day : for the sky is red and lowring . O ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky ; but can ye not discern the signs of the times ?
And when his disciples were come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
Do ye not yet understand , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
And I say also unto thee , That thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ .
From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples , how that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it .
For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works .
And after six days Jesus taketh Peter , James , and John his brother , and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart ,
And was transfigured before them : and his face did shine as the sun , and his raiment was white as the light .
And , behold , there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him .
And when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
And when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save Jesus only .
Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist .
And when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , kneeling down to him , and saying ,
And Jesus rebuked the devil ; and he departed out of him : and the child was cured from that very hour .
And Jesus called a little child unto him , and set him in the midst of them ,
Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
Woe unto the world because of offences ! for it must needs be that offences come ; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh !
And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost .
And if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray .
Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
But if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
And if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church : but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican .
Again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven .
And when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him , which owed him ten thousand talents .
But forasmuch as he had not to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
So when his fellowservants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
And his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him .
And it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these sayings , he departed from Galilee , and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan ;
And great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there .
Then were there brought unto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
And he laid his hands on them , and departed thence .
And every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name 's sake , shall receive an hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life .
But many that are first shall be last ; and the last shall be first .
But when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
And when they had received it , they murmured against the goodman of the house ,
Take that thine is , and go thy way : I will give unto this last , even as unto thee .
And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way , and said unto them ,
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee 's children with her sons , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him .
And when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation against the two brethren .
But it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ;
And whosoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant :
And as they departed from Jericho , a great multitude followed him .
So Jesus had compassion on them , and touched their eyes : and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed him .
And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem , and were come to Bethphage , unto the mount of Olives , then sent Jesus two disciples ,
And the disciples went , and did as Jesus commanded them ,
And brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their clothes , and they set him thereon .
And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ; others cut down branches from the trees , and strawed them in the way .
And Jesus went into the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ,
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
And he left them , and went out of the city into Bethany ; and he lodged there .
Now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hungered .
For John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
And when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it .
Again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them likewise .
And they caught him , and cast him out of the vineyard , and slew him .
And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them .
But when they sought to lay hands on him , they feared the multitude , because they took him for a prophet .
And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
And the remnant took his servants , and entreated them spitefully , and slew them .
But when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
So those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
Then went the Pharisees , and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk .
When they had heard these words , they marvelled , and left him , and went their way .
The same day came to him the Sadducees , which say that there is no resurrection , and asked him ,
And last of all the woman died also .
For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in heaven .
But as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying ,
And when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine .
But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , they were gathered together .
Then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
This is the first and great commandment .
While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
And no man was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
Then spake Jesus to the multitude , and to his disciples ,
All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe , that observe and do ; but do not ye after their works : for they say , and do not .
For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers .
And love the uppermost rooms at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant .
And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased ; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
Ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon .
And whoso shall swear by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
And he that shall swear by heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon .
Ye blind guides , which strain at a gnat , and swallow a camel .
Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves , that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets .
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
Wherefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city :
Verily I say unto you , All these things shall come upon this generation .
Behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
And Jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple .
And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places .
And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another .
And many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many .
And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold .
But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house :
Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes .
But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on the sabbath day :
For then shall be great tribulation , such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor ever shall be .
For there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shall shew great signs and wonders ; insomuch that , if it were possible , they shall deceive the very elect .
Behold , I have told you before .
For as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
For wheresoever the carcase is , there will the eagles be gathered together .
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
So likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .
Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark ,
And knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
Then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
Two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
But know this , that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
Therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh .
Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
Verily I say unto you , That he shall make him ruler over all his goods .
And shall begin to smite his fellowservants , and to eat and drink with the drunken ;
The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him , and in an hour that he is not aware of ,
And five of them were wise , and five were foolish .
They that were foolish took their lamps , and took no oil with them :
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
While the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
And likewise he that had received two , he also gained other two .
But he that had received one went and digged in the earth , and hid his lord 's money .
For unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath .
And before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats :
And he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
For I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in :
When saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
For I was an hungred , and ye gave me no meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink :
And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished all these sayings , he said unto his disciples ,
Then assembled together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , unto the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty , and kill him .
Now when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper ,
There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment , and poured it on his head , as he sat at meat .
For ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always .
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body , she did it for my burial .
Then one of the twelve , called Judas Iscariot , went unto the chief priests ,
And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him .
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them ; and they made ready the passover .
Now when the even was come , he sat down with the twelve .
For this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
And he came and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy .
And he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
And while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
And , behold , one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest 's , and smote off his ear .
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father , and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels ?
And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest 's palace , and went in , and sat with the servants , to see the end .
Now the chief priests , and elders , and all the council , sought false witness against Jesus , to put him to death ;
But found none : yea , though many false witnesses came , yet found they none . At the last came two false witnesses ,
Then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him ; and others smote him with the palms of their hands ,
When the morning was come , all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
And when they had bound him , they led him away , and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor .
Then Judas , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself .
And they took counsel , and bought with them the potter 's field , to bury strangers in .
Wherefore that field was called , The field of blood , unto this day .
And gave them for the potter 's field , as the Lord appointed me .
And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
And he answered him to never a word ; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
And they had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas .
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him .
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
Then released he Barabbas unto them : and when he had scourged Jesus , he delivered him to be crucified .
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall , and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers .
And they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
And they spit upon him , and took the reed , and smote him on the head .
And after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him .
And as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name : him they compelled to bear his cross .
And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull ,
They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted thereof , he would not drink .
And they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , They parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture did they cast lots .
And sitting down they watched him there ;
Then were there two thieves crucified with him , one on the right hand , and another on the left .
And they that passed by reviled him , wagging their heads ,
Likewise also the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders , said ,
The thieves also , which were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth .
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour .
And straightway one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
Jesus , when he had cried again with a loud voice , yielded up the ghost .
And , behold , the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom ; and the earth did quake , and the rocks rent ;
And the graves were opened ; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose ,
And came out of the graves after his resurrection , and went into the holy city , and appeared unto many .
And many women were there beholding afar off , which followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering unto him :
Among which was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of Zebedee 's children .
When the even was come , there came a rich man of Arimathaea , named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus ' disciple :
He went to Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered .
And when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
And laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock : and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre , and departed .
And there was Mary Magdalene , and the other Mary , sitting over against the sepulchre .
Now the next day , that followed the day of the preparation , the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate ,
So they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , and setting a watch .
In the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre .
And , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
His countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snow :
And for fear of him the keepers did shake , and became as dead men .
He is not here : for he is risen , as he said . Come , see the place where the Lord lay .
And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy ; and did run to bring his disciples word .
And as they went to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , All hail . And they came and held him by the feet , and worshipped him .
Now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
And when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers ,
So they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day .
Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee , into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them .
And when they saw him , they worshipped him : but some doubted .
Go ye therefore , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost :
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God ;
John did baptize in the wilderness , and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins .
And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , confessing their sins .
And John was clothed with camel 's hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ;
And it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
And straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him :
And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness .
Now after that John was put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God ,
Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
And straightway they forsook their nets , and followed him .
And when he had gone a little further thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
And they went into Capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue , and taught .
And they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes .
And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
And when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
And forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
But Simon 's wife 's mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they tell him of her .
And he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
And at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
And all the city was gathered together at the door .
And in the morning , rising up a great while before day , he went out , and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed .
And Simon and they that were with him followed after him .
And as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
And he straitly charged him , and forthwith sent him away ;
And again he entered into Capernaum , after some days ; and it was noised that he was in the house .
And straightway many were gathered together , insomuch that there was no room to receive them , no , not so much as about the door : and he preached the word unto them .
And they come unto him , bringing one sick of the palsy , which was borne of four .
And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay .
But there were certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
And he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resorted unto him , and he taught them .
And it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
And it came to pass , that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day ; and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of corn .
And he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a withered hand .
And they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
And the Pharisees went forth , and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judaea ,
And from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and from beyond Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him .
And he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
For he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
And he goeth up into a mountain , and calleth unto him whom he would : and they came unto him .
And he ordained twelve , that they should be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach ,
And to have power to heal sicknesses , and to cast out devils :
And Simon he surnamed Peter ;
And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Canaanite ,
And the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
And when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
And if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
And if a house be divided against itself , that house cannot stand .
And if Satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he cannot stand , but hath an end .
There came then his brethren and his mother , and , standing without , sent unto him , calling him .
And he began again to teach by the sea side : and there was gathered unto him a great multitude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat in the sea ; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land .
And it came to pass , as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
And some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth :
But when the sun was up , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
And some fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
And when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable .
The sower soweth the word .
And these are they by the way side , where the word is sown ; but when they have heard , Satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts .
And have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word 's sake , immediately they are offended .
And the cares of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful .
For there is nothing hid , which shall not be manifested ; neither was any thing kept secret , but that it should come abroad .
If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
And he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear .
It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown in the earth , is less than all the seeds that be in the earth :
And with many such parables spake he the word unto them , as they were able to hear it .
And when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . And there were also with him other little ships .
And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
And they came over unto the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gadarenes .
And when he was come out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
Who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains :
Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
And always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
But when he saw Jesus afar off , he ran and worshipped him ,
And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding .
And forthwith Jesus gave them leave . And the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were choked in the sea .
And they that fed the swine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . And they went out to see what it was that was done .
And they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil , and also concerning the swine .
And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts .
And when he was come into the ship , he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him .
And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
And , behold , there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and when he saw him , he fell at his feet ,
And Jesus went with him ; and much people followed him , and thronged him .
And a certain woman , which had an issue of blood twelve years ,
And had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
When she had heard of Jesus , came in the press behind , and touched his garment .
And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague .
And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
And he suffered no man to follow him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James .
And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly .
And they laughed him to scorn . But when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
And straightway the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . And they were astonished with a great astonishment .
And he went out from thence , and came into his own country ; and his disciples follow him .
And he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
And he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ;
But be shod with sandals ; and not put on two coats .
And he said unto them , In what place soever ye enter into an house , there abide till ye depart from that place .
And they went out , and preached that men should repent .
For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife : for he had married her .
For John had said unto Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother 's wife .
Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him , and would have killed him ; but she could not :
For Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just man and an holy , and observed him ; and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly .
And when a convenient day was come , that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords , high captains , and chief estates of Galilee ;
And the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath 's sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her .
And immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
And brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother .
And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
And they departed into a desert place by ship privately .
And the people saw them departing , and many knew him , and ran afoot thither out of all cities , and outwent them , and came together unto him .
And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
And they did all eat , and were filled .
And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
And when he had sent them away , he departed into a mountain to pray .
And when even was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
And he saw them toiling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them .
But when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out :
And he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
And when they had passed over , they came into the land of Gennesaret , and drew to the shore .
And when they were come out of the ship , straightway they knew him ,
And ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
Then came together unto him the Pharisees , and certain of the scribes , which came from Jerusalem .
For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
And when they come from the market , except they wash , they eat not . And many other things there be , which they have received to hold , as the washing of cups , and pots , brasen vessels , and of tables .
And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother ;
If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
And when he was entered into the house from the people , his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
Thefts , covetousness , wickedness , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , foolishness :
And from thence he arose , and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
For a certain woman , whose young daughter had an unclean spirit , heard of him , and came and fell at his feet :
The woman was a Greek , a Syrophenician by nation ; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
And when she was come to her house , she found the devil gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
And again , departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon , he came unto the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis .
And they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him .
And he took him aside from the multitude , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spit , and touched his tongue ;
And straightway his ears were opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plain .
And he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it ;
In those days the multitude being very great , and having nothing to eat , Jesus called his disciples unto him , and saith unto them ,
And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
And they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
So they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets .
And they that had eaten were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
And the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf .
Having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ?
And he cometh to Bethsaida ; and they bring a blind man unto him , and besought him to touch him .
After that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
And he spake that saying openly . And Peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel 's , the same shall save it .
For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them .
And his raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow ; so as no fuller on earth can white them .
And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus .
For he wist not what to say ; for they were sore afraid .
And suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
And they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean .
And when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
And straightway all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
And they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming .
But Jesus took him by the hand , and lifted him up ; and he arose .
And they departed thence , and passed through Galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
But they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest .
And he took a child , and set him in the midst of them : and when he had taken him in his arms , he said unto them ,
For he that is not against us is on our part .
And if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
And if thy foot offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
And he arose from thence , and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan : and the people resort unto him again ; and , as he was wont , he taught them again .
And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter .
And they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life .
And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus went before them : and they were amazed ; and as they followed , they were afraid . And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen unto him ,
And when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John .
But so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister :
And whosoever of you will be the chiefest , shall be servant of all .
And they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging .
And he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus .
And when they came nigh to Jerusalem , unto Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount of Olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples ,
And they went their way , and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
And they brought the colt to Jesus , and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him .
And many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
And on the morrow , when they were come from Bethany , he was hungry :
And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find any thing thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for the time of figs was not yet .
And they come to Jerusalem : and Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ;
And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple .
And the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
And in the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots .
Therefore I say unto you , What things soever ye desire , when ye pray , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them .
And they come again to Jerusalem : and as he was walking in the temple , there come to him the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders ,
And they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
And again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
And they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , to catch him in his words .
Then come unto him the Sadducees , which say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying ,
Now there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed .
And the second took her , and died , neither left he any seed : and the third likewise .
And the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also .
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment .
And the chief seats in the synagogues , and the uppermost rooms at feasts :
And Jesus sat over against the treasury , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
And there came a certain poor widow , and she threw in two mites , which make a farthing .
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately ,
And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
And the gospel must first be published among all nations .
But when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak , neither do ye premeditate : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy Ghost .
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment .
And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter .
For in those days shall be affliction , such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time , neither shall be .
And except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect 's sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
For false Christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall shew signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect .
So ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
Take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
Watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh , at even , or at midnight , or at the cockcrowing , or in the morning :
Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
After two days was the feast of the passover , and of unleavened bread : and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
For ye have the poor with you always , and whensoever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
She hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying .
And Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went unto the chief priests , to betray him unto them .
And his disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
And in the evening he cometh with the twelve .
And he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it .
Verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
And he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heavy ;
And again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words .
And when he returned , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) neither wist they what to answer him .
And immediately , while he yet spake , cometh Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
And they laid their hands on him , and took him .
And one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
And they all forsook him , and fled .
And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
And Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none .
For many bare false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together .
And there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
But neither so did their witness agree together .
And as Peter was beneath in the palace , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest :
And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council , and bound Jesus , and carried him away , and delivered him to Pilate .
And the chief priests accused him of many things : but he answered nothing .
But Jesus yet answered nothing ; so that Pilate marvelled .
Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner , whomsoever they desired .
And there was one named Barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy .
But the chief priests moved the people , that he should rather release Barabbas unto them .
And so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas unto them , and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
And the soldiers led him away into the hall , called Praetorium ; and they call together the whole band .
And they clothed him with purple , and platted a crown of thorns , and put it about his head ,
And they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
And when they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him .
And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian , who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to bear his cross .
And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
And it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
And with him they crucify two thieves ; the one on his right hand , and the other on his left .
And the scripture was fulfilled , which saith , And he was numbered with the transgressors .
And when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
And Jesus cried with a loud voice , and gave up the ghost .
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom .
There were also women looking on afar off : among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ;
( Who also , when he was in Galilee , followed him , and ministered unto him ; ) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem .
And now when the even was come , because it was the preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath ,
Joseph of Arimathaea , and honourable counseller , which also waited for the kingdom of God , came , and went in boldly unto Pilate , and craved the body of Jesus .
And he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre .
And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid .
And when the sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome , had bought sweet spices , that they might come and anoint him .
And very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun .
And when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away : for it was very great .
And entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted .
And they went out quickly , and fled from the sepulchre ; for they trembled and were amazed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , out of whom he had cast seven devils .
And they , when they had heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , believed not .
After that he appeared in another form unto two of them , as they walked , and went into the country .
And they went and told it unto the residue : neither believed they them .
Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be damned .
And these signs shall follow them that believe ; In my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
So then after the Lord had spoken unto them , he was received up into heaven , and sat on the right hand of God .
And they went forth , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word with signs following . Amen .
Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us ,
Even as they delivered them unto us , which from the beginning were eyewitnesses , and ministers of the word ;
It seemed good to me also , having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent Theophilus ,
That thou mightest know the certainty of those things , wherein thou hast been instructed .
There was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abia : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
And they were both righteous before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless .
And it came to pass , that while he executed the priest 's office before God in the order of his course ,
According to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord .
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense .
And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
And when Zacharias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
And thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost , even from his mother 's womb .
And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God .
And the people waited for Zacharias , and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple .
And when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : for he beckoned unto them , and remained speechless .
And it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
And , behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name JESUS .
He shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the Highest : and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David :
And , behold , thy cousin Elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren .
And Mary arose in those days , and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Juda ;
And entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth .
And it came to pass , that , when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost :
And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
For , lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
And Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord ,
For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things ; and holy is his name .
And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
He hath shewed strength with his arm ; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
He hath put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of low degree .
He hath filled the hungry with good things ; and the rich he hath sent empty away .
He hath holpen his servant Israel , in remembrance of his mercy ;
And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her own house .
Now Elisabeth 's full time came that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her ; and they rejoiced with her .
And it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child ; and they called him Zacharias , after the name of his father .
And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , and praised God .
And fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea .
And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost , and prophesied , saying ,
And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ;
As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets , which have been since the world began :
That we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
To perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy covenant ;
The oath which he sware to our father Abraham ,
That he would grant unto us , that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear ,
In holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life .
And thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the Highest : for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways ;
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins ,
Through the tender mercy of our God ; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us ,
And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel .
And it came to pass in those days , that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus , that all the world should be taxed .
( And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria . )
And all went to be taxed , every one into his own city .
And Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David : )
To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife , being great with child .
And so it was , that , while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered .
And she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .
And , lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord .
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying ,
And they came with haste , and found Mary , and Joseph , and the babe lying in a manger .
And when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds .
But Mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart .
And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them .
And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called JESUS , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ;
And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
And , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
And he came by the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law ,
Then took he him up in his arms , and blessed God , and said ,
For mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ;
And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him .
And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Aser : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ;
And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day .
And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord , and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem .
And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth .
And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover .
And when he was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast .
And when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it .
But they , supposing him to have been in the company , went a day 's journey ; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance .
And when they found him not , they turned back again to Jerusalem , seeking him .
And it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers .
And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
And he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subject unto them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favour with God and man .
Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests , the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness .
And he came into all the country about Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ;
Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ;
And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people .
But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip 's wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done ,
Now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that Jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli ,
Which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Janna , which was the son of Joseph ,
Which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Amos , which was the son of Naum , which was the son of Esli , which was the son of Nagge ,
Which was the son of Maath , which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Semei , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Juda ,
Which was the son of Joanna , which was the son of Rhesa , which was the son of Zorobabel , which was the son of Salathiel , which was the son of Neri ,
Which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Addi , which was the son of Cosam , which was the son of Elmodam , which was the son of Er ,
Which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eliezer , which was the son of Jorim , which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi ,
Which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of Juda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jonan , which was the son of Eliakim ,
Which was the son of Melea , which was the son of Menan , which was the son of Mattatha , which was the son of Nathan , which was the son of David ,
Which was the son of Jesse , which was the son of Obed , which was the son of Booz , which was the son of Salmon , which was the son of Naasson ,
Which was the son of Aminadab , which was the son of Aram , which was the son of Esrom , which was the son of Phares , which was the son of Juda ,
Which was the son of Jacob , which was the son of Isaac , which was the son of Abraham , which was the son of Thara , which was the son of Nachor ,
Which was the son of Saruch , which was the son of Ragau , which was the son of Phalec , which was the son of Heber , which was the son of Sala ,
Which was the son of Cainan , which was the son of Arphaxad , which was the son of Sem , which was the son of Noe , which was the son of Lamech ,
Which was the son of Mathusala , which was the son of Enoch , which was the son of Jared , which was the son of Maleleel , which was the son of Cainan ,
Which was the son of Enos , which was the son of Seth , which was the son of Adam , which was the son of God .
And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness ,
Being forty days tempted of the devil . And in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungered .
And the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read .
And he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him .
But unto none of them was Elias sent , save unto Sarepta , a city of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
And all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath ,
And rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
But he passing through the midst of them went his way ,
And came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the sabbath days .
And they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power .
And in the synagogue there was a man , which had a spirit of an unclean devil , and cried out with a loud voice ,
And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about .
And he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . And Simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
And he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered unto them .
Now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
And when it was day , he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came unto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them .
And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee .
And it came to pass , that , as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God , he stood by the lake of Gennesaret ,
And saw two ships standing by the lake : but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
And he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon 's , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land . And he sat down , and taught the people out of the ship .
And when they had this done , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes : and their net brake .
And they beckoned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . And they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink .
And when they had brought their ships to land , they forsook all , and followed him .
But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
And he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed .
And it came to pass on a certain day , as he was teaching , that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , which were come out of every town of Galilee , and Judaea , and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was present to heal them .
And , behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus .
And immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his own house , glorifying God .
And he left all , rose up , and followed him .
And Levi made him a great feast in his own house : and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them .
And no man putteth new wine into old bottles ; else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles shall perish .
But new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are preserved .
And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first , that he went through the corn fields ; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn , and did eat , rubbing them in their hands .
And it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
And the scribes and Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath day ; that they might find an accusation against him .
And it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to God .
Simon , ( whom he also named Peter , ) and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew ,
Matthew and Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon called Zelotes ,
And Judas the brother of James , and Judas Iscariot , which also was the traitor .
And he came down with them , and stood in the plain , and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem , and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , which came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ;
And they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
And the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went virtue out of him , and healed them all .
Blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . Blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh .
Rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
Woe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . Woe unto you that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep .
Bless them that curse you , and pray for them which despitefully use you .
And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also .
Give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
And if ye do good to them which do good to you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also do even the same .
And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much again .
Be ye therefore merciful , as your Father also is merciful .
The disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
For every tree is known by his own fruit . For of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh .
He is like a man which built an house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock .
Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , he entered into Capernaum .
And a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready to die .
And when he heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the Jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant .
Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee : but say in a word , and my servant shall be healed .
And they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole that had been sick .
And it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called Nain ; and many of his disciples went with him , and much people .
Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
And he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . And he delivered him to his mother .
And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea , and throughout all the region round about .
And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things .
And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they which are gorgeously apparelled , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
But what went ye out for to see ? A prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
And all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves , being not baptized of him .
And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . And he went into the Pharisee 's house , and sat down to meat .
And stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
Thou gavest me no kiss : but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment .
And it came to pass afterward , that he went throughout every city and village , preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God : and the twelve were with him ,
And certain women , which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities , Mary called Magdalene , out of whom went seven devils ,
And some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it .
Those by the way side are they that hear ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved .
But that on the good ground are they , which in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience .
For nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid , that shall not be known and come abroad .
Then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come at him for the press .
But as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is over against Galilee .
And when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs .
And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep .
And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . And he suffered them .
Then went the devils out of the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake , and were choked .
When they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country .
Then they went out to see what was done ; and came to Jesus , and found the man , out of whom the devils were departed , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed .
Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship , and returned back again .
Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him : but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
And it came to pass , that , when Jesus was returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him .
And , behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and besought him that he would come into his house :
For he had one only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she lay a dying . But as he went the people thronged him .
And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , which had spent all her living upon physicians , neither could be healed of any ,
Came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately her issue of blood stanched .
And when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately .
And when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the maiden .
And they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
And her parents were astonished : but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done .
Then he called his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all devils , and to cure diseases .
And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick .
And whatsoever house ye enter into , there abide , and thence depart .
And they departed , and went through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing every where .
And the apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . And he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida .
And the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing .
And they did so , and made them all sit down .
Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
And they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
For what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his Father 's , and of the holy angels .
And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
And as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
And , behold , there talked with him two men , which were Moses and Elias :
Who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem .
But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
While he thus spake , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud .
And when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . And they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
And it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
And , lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him that he foameth again , and bruising him hardly departeth from him .
And as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying .
Then there arose a reasoning among them , which of them should be greatest .
And Jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him ,
And it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
And sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him .
And they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem .
But he turned , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
For the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . And they went to another village .
After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , whither he himself would come .
Carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes : and salute no man by the way .
And if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again .
And in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . Go not from house to house .
But I say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom , than for that city .
But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment , than for you .
And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shalt be thrust down to hell .
Behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
And likewise a Levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
And went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
Now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
And she had a sister called Mary , which also sat at Jesus ' feet , and heard his word .
Give us day by day our daily bread .
I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
And I say unto you , Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
Or if he shall ask an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ?
And he was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . And it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
And others , tempting him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
If Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub .
And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
But if I with the finger of God cast out devils , no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you .
But when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils .
And when he cometh , he findeth it swept and garnished .
For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation .
The light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness .
And as he spake , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
And when the Pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner .
Ye fools , did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ?
But rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and , behold , all things are clean unto you .
Woe unto you ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres .
From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias , which perished between the altar and the temple : verily I say unto you , It shall be required of this generation .
And as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
Laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something out of his mouth , that they might accuse him .
For there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; neither hid , that shall not be known .
But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : Fear him , which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea , I say unto you , Fear him .
But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
Also I say unto you , Whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God :
But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God .
The life is more than meat , and the body is more than raiment .
Consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap ; which neither have storehouse nor barn ; and God feedeth them : how much more are ye better than the fowls ?
And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit ?
If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ?
If then God so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
For all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
But rather seek ye the kingdom of God ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
Sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
Blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him in sunder , and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers .
But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished !
Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you , Nay ; but rather division :
For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
Ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth ; but how is it that ye do not discern this time ?
When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate , as thou art in the way , give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him ; lest he hale thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison .
There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans , whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices .
I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
Or those eighteen , upon whom the tower in Siloam fell , and slew them , think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem ?
And he answering said unto him , Lord , let it alone this year also , till I shall dig about it , and dung it :
And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath .
And , behold , there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could in no wise lift up herself .
And he laid his hands on her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God .
And when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
And he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward Jerusalem .
And they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of God .
Nevertheless I must walk to day , and to morrow , and the day following : for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem .
And it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day , that they watched him .
And , behold , there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy .
And they held their peace . And he took him , and healed him , and let him go ;
And they could not answer him again to these things .
But when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind :
And there went great multitudes with him : and he turned , and said unto them ,
And whosoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , cannot be my disciple .
Lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him ,
Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him .
And when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
I say unto you , that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just persons , which need no repentance .
And when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land ; and he began to be in want .
And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
And bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry :
He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much : and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much .
If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man 's , who shall give you that which is your own ?
And the Pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things : and they derided him .
And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus , which was laid at his gate , full of sores ,
And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man 's table : moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
And in hell he lift up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom .
It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones .
And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
And will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him ? I trow not .
And it came to pass , as he went to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee .
And as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off :
And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified God ,
And fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan .
But first must he suffer many things , and be rejected of this generation .
They did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed .
Remember Lot 's wife .
I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
And shall not God avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican .
And they brought unto him also infants , that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
And when he heard this , he was very sorrowful : for he was very rich .
For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and spitefully entreated , and spitted on :
And they understood none of these things : and this saying was hid from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken .
And it came to pass , that as he was come nigh unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :
And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho .
And , behold , there was a man named Zacchaeus , which was the chief among the publicans , and he was rich .
And he sought to see Jesus who he was ; and could not for the press , because he was little of stature .
And he ran before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
And he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully .
And as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear .
Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank , that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury ?
But those mine enemies , which would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
And when he had thus spoken , he went before , ascending up to Jerusalem .
And it came to pass , when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount called the mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
And they that were sent went their way , and found even as he had said unto them .
And they brought him to Jesus : and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set Jesus thereon .
And as he went , they spread their clothes in the way .
And when he was come nigh , even now at the descent of the mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ;
And when he was come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it ,
For the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
And he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ;
And he taught daily in the temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
And could not find what they might do : for all the people were very attentive to hear him .
And it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he taught the people in the temple , and preached the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders ,
And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
And again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and entreated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
And again he sent a third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out .
And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
And they watched him , and sent forth spies , which should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor .
But he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ?
And they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
And the second took her to wife , and he died childless .
And the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died .
Last of all the woman died also .
But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
Neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection .
Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
And he looked up , and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury .
And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
And it shall turn to you for a testimony .
Settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer :
For I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist .
And ye shall be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolks , and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake .
But there shall not an hair of your head perish .
In your patience possess ye your souls .
Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
For these be the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
Men 's hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
When they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand .
So likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand .
Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth .
And in the day time he was teaching in the temple ; and at night he went out , and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives .
Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the Passover .
Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot , being of the number of the twelve .
And he went his way , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him unto them .
And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
Then came the day of unleavened bread , when the passover must be killed .
And they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him .
For I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come .
And there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
But ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
For whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at meat ? but I am among you as he that serveth .
And I appoint unto you a kingdom , as my Father hath appointed unto me ;
That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone 's cast , and kneeled down , and prayed ,
And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven , strengthening him .
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly : and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
And while he yet spake , behold a multitude , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him .
And one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
Then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest 's house . And Peter followed afar off .
And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , Peter sat down among them .
And Peter went out , and wept bitterly .
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him .
And as soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together , and led him into their council , saying ,
And if I also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go .
And the whole multitude of them arose , and led him unto Pilate .
When Pilate heard of Galilee , he asked whether the man were a Galilaean .
And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
And when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he was desirous to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him .
Then he questioned with him in many words ; but he answered him nothing .
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him .
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate .
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
And Pilate , when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
No , nor yet Herod : for I sent you to him ; and , lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
( For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast . )
( Who for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . )
Pilate therefore , willing to release Jesus , spake again to them .
And they were instant with loud voices , requiring that he might be crucified . And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed .
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required .
And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered Jesus to their will .
And as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cyrenian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after Jesus .
And there followed him a great company of people , and of women , which also bewailed and lamented him .
And there were also two other , malefactors , led with him to be put to death .
And the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , and offering him vinegar ,
And it was about the sixth hour , and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour .
And the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
And all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned .
And all his acquaintance , and the women that followed him from Galilee , stood afar off , beholding these things .
( The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ; ) he was of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of God .
This man went unto Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus .
And he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
And that day was the preparation , and the sabbath drew on .
And the women also , which came with him from Galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulchre , and how his body was laid .
And they returned , and prepared spices and ointments ; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment .
Now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the sepulchre , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre .
And they entered in , and found not the body of the Lord Jesus .
And it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments :
He is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee ,
And they remembered his words ,
And returned from the sepulchre , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the rest .
It was Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the apostles .
And their words seemed to them as idle tales , and they believed them not .
Then arose Peter , and ran unto the sepulchre ; and stooping down , he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
And , behold , two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus , which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs .
And they talked together of all these things which had happened .
And it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
But their eyes were holden that they should not know him .
And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have crucified him .
But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel : and beside all this , to day is the third day since these things were done .
Yea , and certain women also of our company made us astonished , which were early at the sepulchre ;
And beginning at Moses and all the prophets , he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
And they drew nigh unto the village , whither they went : and he made as though he would have gone further .
And it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and blessed it , and brake , and gave to them .
And their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight .
And they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
And they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread .
But they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
And when he had thus spoken , he shewed them his hands and his feet .
And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb .
And he took it , and did eat before them .
Then opened he their understanding , that they might understand the scriptures ,
And he led them out as far as to Bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
And it came to pass , while he blessed them , he was parted from them , and carried up into heaven .
And they worshipped him , and returned to Jerusalem with great joy :
And were continually in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen .
In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
The same was in the beginning with God .
All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made .
In him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not .
There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
The same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light .
That was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world .
He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
He came unto his own , and his own received him not .
But as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name :
Which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
And of his fulness have all we received , and grace for grace .
For the law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ .
No man hath seen God at any time ; the only begotten Son , which is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared him .
And they which were sent were of the Pharisees .
These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan , where John was baptizing .
Again the next day after John stood , and two of his disciples ;
And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus .
One of the two which heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother .
Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there :
And both Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage .
And there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ; ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom ,
This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested forth his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
After this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples : and they continued there not many days .
And the Jews ' passover was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem ,
And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting :
And when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ;
But he spake of the temple of his body .
When therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
But Jesus did not commit himself unto them , because he knew all men ,
And needed not that any should testify of man : for he knew what was in man .
There was a man of the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews :
That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
Marvel not that I said unto thee , Ye must be born again .
Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
If I have told you earthly things , and ye believe not , how shall ye believe , if I tell you of heavenly things ?
For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life .
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be saved .
And this is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved .
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in God .
After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
For John was not yet cast into prison .
Then there arose a question between some of John 's disciples and the Jews about purifying .
He that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
He must increase , but I must decrease .
And what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony .
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true .
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God : for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him .
The Father loveth the Son , and hath given all things into his hand .
When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John ,
( Though Jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples , )
He left Judaea , and departed again into Galilee .
And he must needs go through Samaria .
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
Now Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
( For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat . )
Ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salvation is of the Jews .
But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
The woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men ,
Then they went out of the city , and came unto him .
And he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
So when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
And many more believed because of his own word ;
Now after two days he departed thence , and went into Galilee .
For Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country .
Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum .
When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death .
This is again the second miracle that Jesus did , when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee .
After this there was a feast of the Jews ; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda , having five porches .
In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
And a certain man was there , which had an infirmity thirty and eight years .
And immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath day .
For as the Father raiseth up the dead , and quickeneth them ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will .
That all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
For as the Father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ;
And hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man .
Marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice ,
And shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation .
There is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
But I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye might be saved .
He was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light .
And the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not .
Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me .
But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
I am come in my Father 's name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from God only ?
Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust .
For had ye believed Moses , ye would have believed me : for he wrote of me .
After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee , which is the sea of Tiberias .
And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased .
And Jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
And the passover , a feast of the Jews , was nigh .
And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother , saith unto him ,
And Jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would .
Therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
And when even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea ,
And entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus was not come to them .
And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
Then they willingly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went .
The day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there , save that one whereinto his disciples were entered , and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone ;
( Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks : )
When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus .
But I said unto you , That ye also have seen me , and believe not .
All that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out .
For I came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
And this is the Father 's will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
No man can come to me , except the Father which hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day .
Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he which is of God , he hath seen the Father .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me hath everlasting life .
I am that bread of life .
Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness , and are dead .
This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
Whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and I in him .
As the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
These things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before ?
From that time many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve .
After these things Jesus walked in Galilee : for he would not walk in Jewry , because the Jews sought to kill him .
Now the Jews ' feast of tabernacles was at hand .
For neither did his brethren believe in him .
The world cannot hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that the works thereof are evil .
When he had said these words unto them , he abode still in Galilee .
But when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews .
Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
But , lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ?
Then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
( But this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy Ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified . )
So there was a division among the people because of him .
And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him ?
Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them , )
And every man went unto his own house .
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives .
And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery ; and when they had set her in the midst ,
Now Moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ?
This they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
And again he stooped down , and wrote on the ground .
And they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
Ye judge after the flesh ; I judge no man .
And yet if I judge , my judgment is true : for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me .
It is also written in your law , that the testimony of two men is true .
These words spake Jesus in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
They understood not that he spake to them of the Father .
As he spake these words , many believed on him .
And the servant abideth not in the house for ever : but the Son abideth ever .
If the Son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
I know that ye are Abraham 's seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
But now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Abraham .
Why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye cannot hear my word .
Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it .
And because I tell you the truth , ye believe me not .
Which of you convinceth me of sin ? And if I say the truth , why do ye not believe me ?
And I seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth .
Yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
Then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
And as Jesus passed by , he saw a man which was blind from his birth .
I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
When he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay ,
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
But the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
These words spake his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
Therefore said his parents , He is of age ; ask him .
Now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind .
But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
To him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
And when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
This parable spake Jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
The thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
But he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
The hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
And other sheep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd .
Therefore doth my Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I might take it again .
There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings .
And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication , and it was winter .
And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon 's porch .
But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as I said unto you .
My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me :
And I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
My Father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father 's hand .
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him .
If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not .
Therefore they sought again to take him : but he escaped out of their hand ,
And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized ; and there he abode .
Now a certain man was sick , named Lazarus , of Bethany , the town of Mary and her sister Martha .
( It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . )
Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
When he had heard therefore that he was sick , he abode two days still in the same place where he was .
Then when Jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off :
And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house .
As soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came unto him .
Now Jesus was not yet come into the town , but was in that place where Martha met him .
The Jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth unto the grave to weep there .
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
Jesus wept .
Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave . It was a cave , and a stone lay upon it .
And I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the people which stand by I said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me .
Then many of the Jews which came to Mary , and had seen the things which Jesus did , believed on him .
But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees , and told them what things Jesus had done .
And this spake he not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation ;
And not for that nation only , but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad .
Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death .
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews ; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with his disciples .
And the Jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves .
Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him .
Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany , where Lazarus was which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
There they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
Then saith one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , which should betray him ,
This he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ;
Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus .
On the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
These things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
For this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this miracle .
And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast :
Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
He that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour .
Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
This he said , signifying what death he should die .
But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him :
Therefore they could not believe , because that Esaias said again ,
These things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God .
And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me .
I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness .
He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
For I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
Now before the feast of the passover , when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father , having loved his own which were in the world , he loved them unto the end .
And supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ;
Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God ;
He riseth from supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and girded himself .
After that he poureth water into a bason , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
Ye call me Master and Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am .
For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
If ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them .
Now I tell you before it come , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he .
Then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
Now there was leaning on Jesus ' bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved .
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake .
Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him .
For some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said unto him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
He then having received the sop went immediately out : and it was night .
If God be glorified in him , God shall also glorify him in himself , and shall straightway glorify him .
In my Father 's house are many mansions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father .
And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
If ye shall ask any thing in my name , I will do it .
And I will pray the Father , and he shall give you another Comforter , that he may abide with you for ever ;
Even the Spirit of truth ; whom the world cannot receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you , and shall be in you .
Yet a little while , and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because I live , ye shall live also .
At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you .
He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father 's which sent me .
But the Comforter , which is the Holy Ghost , whom the Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said unto you .
And now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye might believe .
Hereafter I will not talk much with you : for the prince of this world cometh , and hath nothing in me .
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you .
Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
If a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
Herein is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my disciples .
As the Father hath loved me , so have I loved you : continue ye in my love .
If ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and abide in his love .
These things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
This is my commandment , That ye love one another , as I have loved you .
Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
Ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoever I command you .
Henceforth I call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you .
If ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
But all these things will they do unto you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me .
If I had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no cloke for their sin .
If I had not done among them the works which none other man did , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father .
They shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service .
And these things will they do unto you , because they have not known the Father , nor me .
But because I have said these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
Nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you .
Of sin , because they believe not on me ;
Of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no more ;
Of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged .
Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
He shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
All things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
And ye now therefore have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
And in that day ye shall ask me nothing . Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
At that day ye shall ask in my name : and I say not unto you , that I will pray the Father for you :
For the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that I came out from God .
Behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
As thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him .
And this is life eternal , that they might know thee the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent .
I have glorified thee on the earth : I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do .
Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee .
For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
I pray for them : I pray not for the world , but for them which thou hast given me ; for they are thine .
And all mine are thine , and thine are mine ; and I am glorified in them .
And now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
I have given them thy word ; and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
Sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth .
As thou hast sent me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world .
That they all may be one ; as thou , Father , art in me , and I in thee , that they also may be one in us : that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .
And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them ; that they may be one , even as we are one :
I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
O righteous Father , the world hath not known thee : but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me .
When Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples .
And Judas also , which betrayed him , knew the place : for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples .
Judas then , having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons .
Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it , and smote the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . The servant 's name was Malchus .
Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus , and bound him ,
And led him away to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year .
Now Caiaphas was he , which gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
But Peter stood at the door without . Then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
And the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himself .
The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine .
Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest .
Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying what death he should die .
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus , and scourged him .
And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ;
Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . And they took Jesus , and led him away .
Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst .
This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin .
Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
The Jews therefore , because it was the preparation , that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day , ( for that sabbath day was an high day , ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
Then came the soldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified with him .
But when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs :
But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water .
And he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe .
And after this Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave . He came therefore , and took the body of Jesus .
And there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
Then took they the body of Jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the Jews is to bury .
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulchre , wherein was never man yet laid .
There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews ' preparation day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand .
The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre .
Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre .
So they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the sepulchre .
And he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
Then cometh Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulchre , and seeth the linen clothes lie ,
And the napkin , that was about his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
Then went in also that other disciple , which came first to the sepulchre , and he saw , and believed .
For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
Then the disciples went away again unto their own home .
But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
And seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
And when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
And when he had so said , he shewed unto them his hands and his side . Then were the disciples glad , when they saw the Lord .
But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book :
But these are written , that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God ; and that believing ye might have life through his name .
After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias ; and on this wise shewed he himself .
There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two other of his disciples .
But when the morning was now come , Jesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
And the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes .
As soon then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , and hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
Jesus then cometh , and taketh bread , and giveth them , and fish likewise .
This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples , after that he was risen from the dead .
This is the disciple which testifieth of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his testimony is true .
And there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . Amen .
The former treatise have I made , O Theophilus , of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ,
Until the day in which he was taken up , after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen :
To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs , being seen of them forty days , and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God :
And when he had spoken these things , while they beheld , he was taken up ; and a cloud received him out of their sight .
And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up , behold , two men stood by them in white apparel ;
Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet , which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day 's journey .
And when they were come in , they went up into an upper room , where abode both Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas , Bartholomew , and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon Zelotes , and Judas the brother of James .
These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication , with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brethren .
And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples , and said , ( the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty , )
Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the midst , and all his bowels gushed out .
And they appointed two , Joseph called Barsabas , who was surnamed Justus , and Matthias .
And they gave forth their lots ; and the lot fell upon Matthias ; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
And when the day of Pentecost was fully come , they were all with one accord in one place .
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire , and it sat upon each of them .
And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance .
And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews , devout men , out of every nation under heaven .
Now when this was noised abroad , the multitude came together , and were confounded , because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
Parthians , and Medes , and Elamites , and the dwellers in Mesopotamia , and in Judaea , and Cappadocia , in Pontus , and Asia ,
Phrygia , and Pamphylia , in Egypt , and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene , and strangers of Rome , Jews and proselytes ,
Others mocking said , These men are full of new wine .
And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit ; and they shall prophesy :
And I will shew wonders in heaven above , and signs in the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and vapour of smoke :
The sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before that great and notable day of the Lord come :
Him , being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God , ye have taken , and by wicked hands have crucified and slain :
Whom God hath raised up , having loosed the pains of death : because it was not possible that he should be holden of it .
Therefore did my heart rejoice , and my tongue was glad ; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope :
Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell , neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption .
Therefore being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne ;
This Jesus hath God raised up , whereof we all are witnesses .
Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted , and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
Then they that gladly received his word were baptized : and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls .
And they continued stedfastly in the apostles ' doctrine and fellowship , and in breaking of bread , and in prayers .
And fear came upon every soul : and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles .
And all that believed were together , and had all things common ;
And sold their possessions and goods , and parted them to all men , as every man had need .
And they , continuing daily with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread from house to house , did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart ,
Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer , being the ninth hour .
And a certain man lame from his mother 's womb was carried , whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful , to ask alms of them that entered into the temple ;
Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms .
And he gave heed unto them , expecting to receive something of them .
And he took him by the right hand , and lifted him up : and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength .
And he leaping up stood , and walked , and entered with them into the temple , walking , and leaping , and praising God .
And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
The God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Jacob , the God of our fathers , hath glorified his Son Jesus ; whom ye delivered up , and denied him in the presence of Pilate , when he was determined to let him go .
But ye denied the Holy One and the Just , and desired a murderer to be granted unto you ;
And killed the Prince of life , whom God hath raised from the dead ; whereof we are witnesses .
Repent ye therefore , and be converted , that your sins may be blotted out , when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord ;
And he shall send Jesus Christ , which before was preached unto you :
Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things , which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began .
Yea , and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise foretold of these days .
And as they spake unto the people , the priests , and the captain of the temple , and the Sadducees , came upon them ,
Being grieved that they taught the people , and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
And they laid hands on them , and put them in hold unto the next day : for it was now eventide .
Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed ; and the number of the men was about five thousand .
And it came to pass on the morrow , that their rulers , and elders , and scribes ,
And Annas the high priest , and Caiaphas , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest , were gathered together at Jerusalem .
If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man , by what means he is made whole ;
Be it known unto you all , and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom ye crucified , whom God raised from the dead , even by him doth this man stand here before you whole .
Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marvelled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with Jesus .
And beholding the man which was healed standing with them , they could say nothing against it .
But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
And they called them , and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus .
And being let go , they went to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them .
For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus , whom thou hast anointed , both Herod , and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles , and the people of Israel , were gathered together ,
For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done .
And now , Lord , behold their threatenings : and grant unto thy servants , that with all boldness they may speak thy word ,
And when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldness .
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus : and great grace was upon them all .
Neither was there any among them that lacked : for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold ,
And laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need .
Having land , sold it , and brought the money , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
But a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira his wife , sold a possession ,
And kept back part of the price , his wife also being privy to it , and brought a certain part , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
And it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
Then fell she down straightway at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
And great fear came upon all the church , and upon as many as heard these things .
And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people ; ( and they were all with one accord in Solomon 's porch .
And of the rest durst no man join himself to them : but the people magnified them .
And believers were the more added to the Lord , multitudes both of men and women . )
Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets , and laid them on beds and couches , that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them .
There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem , bringing sick folks , and them which were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed every one .
Then the high priest rose up , and all they that were with him , ( which is the sect of the Sadducees , ) and were filled with indignation ,
And laid their hands on the apostles , and put them in the common prison .
But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors , and brought them forth , and said ,
And when they heard that , they entered into the temple early in the morning , and taught . But the high priest came , and they that were with him , and called the council together , and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought .
But when the officers came , and found them not in the prison , they returned , and told ,
Then went the captain with the officers , and brought them without violence : for they feared the people , lest they should have been stoned .
And when they had brought them , they set them before the council : and the high priest asked them ,
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus , whom ye slew and hanged on a tree .
Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour , for to give repentance to Israel , and forgiveness of sins .
When they heard that , they were cut to the heart , and took counsel to slay them .
Then stood there up one in the council , a Pharisee , named Gamaliel , a doctor of the law , had in reputation among all the people , and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space ;
For before these days rose up Theudas , boasting himself to be somebody ; to whom a number of men , about four hundred , joined themselves : who was slain ; and all , as many as obeyed him , were scattered , and brought to nought .
After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing , and drew away much people after him : he also perished ; and all , even as many as obeyed him , were dispersed .
And to him they agreed : and when they had called the apostles , and beaten them , they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
And they departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name .
And daily in the temple , and in every house , they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ .
And in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplied , there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration .
Wherefore , brethren , look ye out among you seven men of honest report , full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
And the saying pleased the whole multitude : and they chose Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost , and Philip , and Prochorus , and Nicanor , and Timon , and Parmenas , and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch :
Whom they set before the apostles : and when they had prayed , they laid their hands on them .
And the word of God increased ; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly ; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
And Stephen , full of faith and power , did great wonders and miracles among the people .
Then there arose certain of the synagogue , which is called the synagogue of the Libertines , and Cyrenians , and Alexandrians , and of them of Cilicia and of Asia , disputing with Stephen .
And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake .
And they stirred up the people , and the elders , and the scribes , and came upon him , and caught him , and brought him to the council ,
And all that sat in the council , looking stedfastly on him , saw his face as it had been the face of an angel .
And he gave him none inheritance in it , no , not so much as to set his foot on : yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession , and to his seed after him , when as yet he had no child .
And delivered him out of all his afflictions , and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house .
Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan , and great affliction : and our fathers found no sustenance .
And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren ; and Joseph 's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh .
Then sent Joseph , and called his father Jacob to him , and all his kindred , threescore and fifteen souls .
So Jacob went down into Egypt , and died , he , and our fathers ,
And were carried over into Sychem , and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem .
Till another king arose , which knew not Joseph .
The same dealt subtilly with our kindred , and evil entreated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
And when he was cast out , Pharaoh 's daughter took him up , and nourished him for her own son .
And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians , and was mighty in words and in deeds .
And seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him that was oppressed , and smote the Egyptian :
For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them : but they understood not .
Wilt thou kill me , as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday ?
Then fled Moses at this saying , and was a stranger in the land of Madian , where he begat two sons .
He brought them out , after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
This is he , that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina , and with our fathers : who received the lively oracles to give unto us :
And they made a calf in those days , and offered sacrifice unto the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their own hands .
Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles , whom God drave out before the face of our fathers , unto the days of David ;
Who found favour before God , and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob .
But Solomon built him an house .
Heaven is my throne , and earth is my footstool : what house will ye build me ? saith the Lord : or what is the place of my rest ?
Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted ? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One ; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers :
When they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed on him with their teeth .
But he , being full of the Holy Ghost , looked up stedfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
Then they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and ran upon him with one accord ,
And cast him out of the city , and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man 's feet , whose name was Saul .
Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word .
Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria , and preached Christ unto them .
And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
For unclean spirits , crying with loud voice , came out of many that were possessed with them : and many taken with palsies , and that were lame , were healed .
And there was great joy in that city .
But there was a certain man , called Simon , which beforetime in the same city used sorcery , and bewitched the people of Samaria , giving out that himself was some great one :
And to him they had regard , because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries .
But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God , and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
Then Simon himself believed also : and when he was baptized , he continued with Philip , and wondered , beholding the miracles and signs which were done .
Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent unto them Peter and John :
Who , when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Ghost :
( For as yet he was fallen upon none of them : only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus . )
Then laid they their hands on them , and they received the Holy Ghost .
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles ' hands the Holy Ghost was given , he offered them money ,
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right in the sight of God .
And they , when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans .
And he arose and went : and , behold , a man of Ethiopia , an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians , who had the charge of all her treasure , and had come to Jerusalem for to worship ,
Was returning , and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet .
Then Philip opened his mouth , and began at the same scripture , and preached unto him Jesus .
And he commanded the chariot to stand still : and they went down both into the water , both Philip and the eunuch ; and he baptized him .
And when they were come up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip , that the eunuch saw him no more : and he went on his way rejoicing .
But Philip was found at Azotus : and passing through he preached in all the cities , till he came to Caesarea .
And Saul , yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went unto the high priest ,
And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues , that if he found any of this way , whether they were men or women , he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem .
And as he journeyed , he came near Damascus : and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven :
And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless , hearing a voice , but seeing no man .
And Saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales : and he received sight forthwith , and arose , and was baptized .
And when he had received meat , he was strengthened . Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus .
But Saul increased the more in strength , and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus , proving that this is very Christ .
And after that many days were fulfilled , the Jews took counsel to kill him :
But their laying await was known of Saul . And they watched the gates day and night to kill him .
Then the disciples took him by night , and let him down by the wall in a basket .
And when Saul was come to Jerusalem , he assayed to join himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a disciple .
And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem .
And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus , and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him .
Which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him forth to Tarsus .
Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria , and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost , were multiplied .
And it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda .
And there he found a certain man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him , and turned to the Lord .
And it came to pass in those days , that she was sick , and died : whom when they had washed , they laid her in an upper chamber .
And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
Then Peter arose and went with them . When he was come , they brought him into the upper chamber : and all the widows stood by him weeping , and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made , while she was with them .
And it was known throughout all Joppa ; and many believed in the Lord .
And it came to pass , that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner .
There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius , a centurion of the band called the Italian band ,
A devout man , and one that feared God with all his house , which gave much alms to the people , and prayed to God alway .
And now send men to Joppa , and call for one Simon , whose surname is Peter :
And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed , he called two of his household servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
And when he had declared all these things unto them , he sent them to Joppa .
On the morrow , as they went on their journey , and drew nigh unto the city , Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour :
And he became very hungry , and would have eaten : but while they made ready , he fell into a trance ,
And saw heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending unto him , as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners , and let down to the earth :
Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
This was done thrice : and the vessel was received up again into heaven .
Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
Then called he them in , and lodged them . And on the morrow Peter went away with them , and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him .
And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea . And Cornelius waited for them , and had called together his kinsmen and near friends .
And as Peter was coming in , Cornelius met him , and fell down at his feet , and worshipped him .
And as he talked with him , he went in , and found many that were come together .
But in every nation he that feareth him , and worketh righteousness , is accepted with him .
The word which God sent unto the children of Israel , preaching peace by Jesus Christ : ( he is Lord of all : )
How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power : who went about doing good , and healing all that were oppressed of the devil ; for God was with him .
Him God raised up the third day , and shewed him openly ;
Not to all the people , but unto witnesses chosen before of God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
While Peter yet spake these words , the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word .
And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished , as many as came with Peter , because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost .
For they heard them speak with tongues , and magnify God . Then answered Peter ,
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord . Then prayed they him to tarry certain days .
And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God .
And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem , they that were of the circumcision contended with him ,
But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning , and expounded it by order unto them , saying ,
Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes , I considered , and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
And , behold , immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was , sent from Caesarea unto me .
And the spirit bade me go with them , nothing doubting . Moreover these six brethren accompanied me , and we entered into the man 's house :
Who shall tell thee words , whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved .
Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice , and Cyprus , and Antioch , preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only .
And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene , which , when they were come to Antioch , spake unto the Grecians , preaching the Lord Jesus .
And the hand of the Lord was with them : and a great number believed , and turned unto the Lord .
Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem : and they sent forth Barnabas , that he should go as far as Antioch .
Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus , for to seek Saul :
And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch .
Then the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea :
Which also they did , and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul .
Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church .
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword .
And because he saw it pleased the Jews , he proceeded further to take Peter also . ( Then were the days of unleavened bread . )
And when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
Peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him .
And when Herod would have brought him forth , the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains : and the keepers before the door kept the prison .
And he went out , and followed him ; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision .
When they were past the first and the second ward , they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city ; which opened to them of his own accord : and they went out , and passed on through one street ; and forthwith the angel departed from him .
And when he had considered the thing , he came to the house of Mary the mother of John , whose surname was Mark ; where many were gathered together praying .
And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate , a damsel came to hearken , named Rhoda .
But Peter continued knocking : and when they had opened the door , and saw him , they were astonished .
Now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers , what was become of Peter .
And when Herod had sought for him , and found him not , he examined the keepers , and commanded that they should be put to death . And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea , and there abode .
And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon : but they came with one accord to him , and , having made Blastus the king 's chamberlain their friend , desired peace ; because their country was nourished by the king 's country .
And upon a set day Herod , arrayed in royal apparel , sat upon his throne , and made an oration unto them .
And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him , because he gave not God the glory : and he was eaten of worms , and gave up the ghost .
But the word of God grew and multiplied .
And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their ministry , and took with them John , whose surname was Mark .
Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers ; as Barnabas , and Simeon that was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
And when they had fasted and prayed , and laid their hands on them , they sent them away .
So they , being sent forth by the Holy Ghost , departed unto Seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus .
And when they were at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Bar-jesus :
Which was with the deputy of the country , Sergius Paulus , a prudent man ; who called for Barnabas and Saul , and desired to hear the word of God .
But Elymas the sorcerer ( for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them , seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith .
Then Saul , ( who also is called Paul , ) filled with the Holy Ghost , set his eyes on him ,
Then the deputy , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord .
Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos , they came to Perga in Pamphylia : and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem .
But when they departed from Perga , they came to Antioch in Pisidia , and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers , and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt , and with an high arm brought he them out of it .
And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness .
And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan , he divided their land to them by lot .
And afterward they desired a king : and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , by the space of forty years .
When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
For they that dwell at Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they knew him not , nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day , they have fulfilled them in condemning him .
And though they found no cause of death in him , yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain .
But God raised him from the dead :
And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are his witnesses unto the people .
For David , after he had served his own generation by the will of God , fell on sleep , and was laid unto his fathers , and saw corruption :
But he , whom God raised again , saw no corruption .
And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue , the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath .
Now when the congregation was broken up , many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas : who , speaking to them , persuaded them to continue in the grace of God .
And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God .
But when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
And when the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the Lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region .
But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women , and the chief men of the city , and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and expelled them out of their coasts .
But they shook off the dust of their feet against them , and came unto Iconium .
And the disciples were filled with joy , and with the Holy Ghost .
And it came to pass in Iconium , that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews , and so spake , that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed .
But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles , and made their minds evil affected against the brethren .
Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord , which gave testimony unto the word of his grace , and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
But the multitude of the city was divided : and part held with the Jews , and part with the apostles .
And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles , and also of the Jews with their rulers , to use them despitefully , and to stone them ,
They were ware of it , and fled unto Lystra and Derbe , cities of Lycaonia , and unto the region that lieth round about :
And there they preached the gospel .
The same heard Paul speak : who stedfastly beholding him , and perceiving that he had faith to be healed ,
Then the priest of Jupiter , which was before their city , brought oxen and garlands unto the gates , and would have done sacrifice with the people .
And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium , who persuaded the people , and , having stoned Paul , drew him out of the city , supposing he had been dead .
Howbeit , as the disciples stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe .
And when they had preached the gospel to that city , and had taught many , they returned again to Lystra , and to Iconium , and Antioch ,
And when they had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
And after they had passed throughout Pisidia , they came to Pamphylia .
And when they had preached the word in Perga , they went down into Attalia :
And thence sailed to Antioch , from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled .
And there they abode long time with the disciples .
When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them , they determined that Paul and Barnabas , and certain other of them , should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .
And being brought on their way by the church , they passed through Phenice and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
And when they were come to Jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the apostles and elders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter .
And God , which knoweth the hearts , bare them witness , giving them the Holy Ghost , even as he did unto us ;
And put no difference between us and them , purifying their hearts by faith .
Now therefore why tempt ye God , to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
Then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul , declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them .
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles , to take out of them a people for his name .
Then pleased it the apostles and elders , with the whole church , to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas ; namely , Judas surnamed Barsabas , and Silas , chief men among the brethren :
Forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
It seemed good unto us , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
We have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who shall also tell you the same things by mouth .
That ye abstain from meats offered to idols , and from blood , and from things strangled , and from fornication : from which if ye keep yourselves , ye shall do well . Fare ye well .
So when they were dismissed , they came to Antioch : and when they had gathered the multitude together , they delivered the epistle :
Which when they had read , they rejoiced for the consolation .
And Judas and Silas , being prophets also themselves , exhorted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them .
And after they had tarried there a space , they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles .
Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the Lord , with many others also .
And Barnabas determined to take with them John , whose surname was Mark .
But Paul thought not good to take him with them , who departed from them from Pamphylia , and went not with them to the work .
And the contention was so sharp between them , that they departed asunder one from the other : and so Barnabas took Mark , and sailed unto Cyprus ;
And Paul chose Silas , and departed , being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God .
And he went through Syria and Cilicia , confirming the churches .
Then came he to Derbe and Lystra : and , behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timotheus , the son of a certain woman , which was a Jewess , and believed ; but his father was a Greek :
Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium .
Him would Paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters : for they knew all that his father was a Greek .
And as they went through the cities , they delivered them the decrees for to keep , that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem .
And so were the churches established in the faith , and increased in number daily .
Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia , and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia ,
After they were come to Mysia , they assayed to go into Bithynia : but the Spirit suffered them not .
And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas .
And after he had seen the vision , immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia , assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them .
Therefore loosing from Troas , we came with a straight course to Samothracia , and the next day to Neapolis ;
And from thence to Philippi , which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia , and a colony : and we were in that city abiding certain days .
And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side , where prayer was wont to be made ; and we sat down , and spake unto the women which resorted thither .
And a certain woman named Lydia , a seller of purple , of the city of Thyatira , which worshipped God , heard us : whose heart the Lord opened , that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul .
And it came to pass , as we went to prayer , a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us , which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying :
And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught Paul and Silas , and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers ,
And the multitude rose up together against them : and the magistrates rent off their clothes , and commanded to beat them .
Who , having received such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed , and sang praises unto God : and the prisoners heard them .
And suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened , and every one 's bands were loosed .
And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , supposing that the prisoners had been fled .
Then he called for a light , and sprang in , and came trembling , and fell down before Paul and Silas ,
And they spake unto him the word of the Lord , and to all that were in his house .
And he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes ; and was baptized , he and all his , straightway .
And when he had brought them into his house , he set meat before them , and rejoiced , believing in God with all his house .
And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates : and they feared , when they heard that they were Romans .
And they came and besought them , and brought them out , and desired them to depart out of the city .
And they went out of the prison , and entered into the house of Lydia and when they had seen the brethren , they comforted them , and departed .
Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the Jews :
And Paul , as his manner was , went in unto them , and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures ,
And some of them believed , and consorted with Paul and Silas ; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude , and of the chief women not a few .
But the Jews which believed not , moved with envy , took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort , and gathered a company , and set all the city on an uproar , and assaulted the house of Jason , and sought to bring them out to the people .
And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city , when they heard these things .
And when they had taken security of Jason , and of the other , they let them go .
And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea : who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews .
These were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they received the word with all readiness of mind , and searched the scriptures daily , whether those things were so .
Therefore many of them believed ; also of honourable women which were Greeks , and of men , not a few .
But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people .
And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Silas and Timotheus abode there still .
Now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was stirred in him , when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry .
Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews , and with the devout persons , and in the market daily with them that met with him .
( For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell , or to hear some new thing . )
Neither is worshipped with men 's hands , as though he needed any thing , seeing he giveth to all life , and breath , and all things ;
And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth , and hath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation ;
And the times of this ignorance God winked at ; but now commandeth all men every where to repent :
So Paul departed from among them .
Howbeit certain men clave unto him , and believed : among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
After these things Paul departed from Athens , and came to Corinth ;
And found a certain Jew named Aquila , born in Pontus , lately come from Italy , with his wife Priscilla ; ( because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome : ) and came unto them .
And because he was of the same craft , he abode with them , and wrought : for by their occupation they were tentmakers .
And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath , and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks .
And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia , Paul was pressed in the spirit , and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ .
And he departed thence , and entered into a certain man 's house , named Justus , one that worshipped God , whose house joined hard to the synagogue .
And Crispus , the chief ruler of the synagogue , believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed , and were baptized .
And he continued there a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them .
And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia , the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul , and brought him to the judgment seat ,
And he drave them from the judgment seat .
Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes , the chief ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . And Gallio cared for none of those things .
And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while , and then took his leave of the brethren , and sailed thence into Syria , and with him Priscilla and Aquila ; having shorn his head in Cenchrea : for he had a vow .
When they desired him to tarry longer time with them , he consented not ;
And when he had landed at Caesarea , and gone up , and saluted the church , he went down to Antioch .
And after he had spent some time there , he departed , and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
And a certain Jew named Apollos , born at Alexandria , an eloquent man , and mighty in the scriptures , came to Ephesus .
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in the spirit , he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord , knowing only the baptism of John .
And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue : whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard , they took him unto them , and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly .
And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia , the brethren wrote , exhorting the disciples to receive him : who , when he was come , helped them much which had believed through grace :
For he mightily convinced the Jews , and that publickly , shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ .
And it came to pass , that , while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus : and finding certain disciples ,
When they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
And when Paul had laid his hands upon them , the Holy Ghost came on them ; and they spake with tongues , and prophesied .
And all the men were about twelve .
And he went into the synagogue , and spake boldly for the space of three months , disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God .
But when divers were hardened , and believed not , but spake evil of that way before the multitude , he departed from them , and separated the disciples , disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus .
And this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus , both Jews and Greeks .
And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul :
So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons , and the diseases departed from them , and the evil spirits went out of them .
And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them , and overcame them , and prevailed against them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus ; and fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
And many that believed came , and confessed , and shewed their deeds .
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed .
So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , Timotheus and Erastus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
And the same time there arose no small stir about that way .
For a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , which made silver shrines for Diana , brought no small gain unto the craftsmen ;
Moreover ye see and hear , that not alone at Ephesus , but almost throughout all Asia , this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people , saying that they be no gods , which are made with hands :
And the whole city was filled with confusion : and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul 's companions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
And when Paul would have entered in unto the people , the disciples suffered him not .
And certain of the chief of Asia , which were his friends , sent unto him , desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre .
Some therefore cried one thing , and some another : for the assembly was confused ; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together .
And they drew Alexander out of the multitude , the Jews putting him forward . And Alexander beckoned with the hand , and would have made his defence unto the people .
Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against , ye ought to be quiet , and to do nothing rashly .
Wherefore if Demetrius , and the craftsmen which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them implead one another .
And when he had thus spoken , he dismissed the assembly .
And after the uproar was ceased , Paul called unto him the disciples , and embraced them , and departed for to go into Macedonia .
And when he had gone over those parts , and had given them much exhortation , he came into Greece ,
And there abode three months . And when the Jews laid wait for him , as he was about to sail into Syria , he purposed to return through Macedonia .
And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea ; and of the Thessalonians , Aristarchus and Secundus ; and Gaius of Derbe , and Timotheus ; and of Asia , Tychicus and Trophimus .
These going before tarried for us at Troas .
And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread , and came unto them to Troas in five days ; where we abode seven days .
And upon the first day of the week , when the disciples came together to break bread , Paul preached unto them , ready to depart on the morrow ; and continued his speech until midnight .
And there were many lights in the upper chamber , where they were gathered together .
And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus , being fallen into a deep sleep : and as Paul was long preaching , he sunk down with sleep , and fell down from the third loft , and was taken up dead .
When he therefore was come up again , and had broken bread , and eaten , and talked a long while , even till break of day , so he departed .
And they brought the young man alive , and were not a little comforted .
And we went before to ship , and sailed unto Assos , there intending to take in Paul : for so had he appointed , minding himself to go afoot .
And when he met with us at Assos , we took him in , and came to Mitylene .
And we sailed thence , and came the next day over against Chios ; and the next day we arrived at Samos , and tarried at Trogyllium ; and the next day we came to Miletus .
For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .
And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus , and called the elders of the church .
Serving the Lord with all humility of mind , and with many tears , and temptations , which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews :
And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house ,
Testifying both to the Jews , and also to the Greeks , repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ .
Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me .
But none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so that I might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God .
Wherefore I take you to record this day , that I am pure from the blood of all men .
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God .
Take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers , to feed the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
For I know this , that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
Also of your own selves shall men arise , speaking perverse things , to draw away disciples after them .
Therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .
I have coveted no man 's silver , or gold , or apparel .
Yea , ye yourselves know , that these hands have ministered unto my necessities , and to them that were with me .
And when he had thus spoken , he kneeled down , and prayed with them all .
And it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a straight course unto Coos , and the day following unto Rhodes , and from thence unto Patara :
And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia , we went aboard , and set forth .
Now when we had discovered Cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and sailed into Syria , and landed at Tyre : for there the ship was to unlade her burden .
And finding disciples , we tarried there seven days : who said to Paul through the Spirit , that he should not go up to Jerusalem .
And when we had accomplished those days , we departed and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way , with wives and children , till we were out of the city : and we kneeled down on the shore , and prayed .
And when we had taken our leave one of another , we took ship ; and they returned home again .
And when we had finished our course from Tyre , we came to Ptolemais , and saluted the brethren , and abode with them one day .
And the next day we that were of Paul 's company departed , and came unto Caesarea : and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist , which was one of the seven ; and abode with him .
And the same man had four daughters , virgins , which did prophesy .
And as we tarried there many days , there came down from Judaea a certain prophet , named Agabus .
And when we heard these things , both we , and they of that place , besought him not to go up to Jerusalem .
And after those days we took up our carriages , and went up to Jerusalem .
There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea , and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus , an old disciple , with whom we should lodge .
And when we were come to Jerusalem , the brethren received us gladly .
And the day following Paul went in with us unto James ; and all the elders were present .
And when he had saluted them , he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry .
And they are informed of thee , that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses , saying that they ought not to circumcise their children , neither to walk after the customs .
Do therefore this that we say to thee : We have four men which have a vow on them ;
Them take , and purify thyself with them , and be at charges with them , that they may shave their heads : and all may know that those things , whereof they were informed concerning thee , are nothing ; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly , and keepest the law .
Then Paul took the men , and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple , to signify the accomplishment of the days of purifcation , until that an offering should be offered for every one of them .
And when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
( For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian , whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple . )
And all the city was moved , and the people ran together : and they took Paul , and drew him out of the temple : and forthwith the doors were shut .
And as they went about to kill him , tidings came unto the chief captain of the band , that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
Who immediately took soldiers and centurions , and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , they left beating of Paul .
And some cried one thing , some another , among the multitude : and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult , he commanded him to be carried into the castle .
And when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and beckoned with the hand unto the people . And when there was made a great silence , he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying ,
( And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them , they kept the more silence : and he saith , )
And I persecuted this way unto the death , binding and delivering into prisons both men and women .
And they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
And when I could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Damascus .
For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard .
And as they cried out , and cast off their clothes , and threw dust into the air ,
The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle , and bade that he should be examined by scourging ; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him .
Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
On the morrow , because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews , he loosed him from his bands , and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear , and brought Paul down , and set him before them .
And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
And when there arose a great dissension , the chief captain , fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , commanded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
And when it was day , certain of the Jews banded together , and bound themselves under a curse , saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul .
And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy .
And when Paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wait , he went and entered into the castle , and told Paul .
And he wrote a letter after this manner :
Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting .
This man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a Roman .
And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him , I brought him forth into their council :
And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man , I sent straightway to thee , and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him . Farewell .
Then the soldiers , as it was commanded them , took Paul , and brought him by night to Antipatris .
On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him , and returned to the castle :
Who , when they came to Caesarea , and delivered the epistle to the governor , presented Paul also before him .
And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders , and with a certain orator named Tertullus , who informed the governor against Paul .
We accept it always , and in all places , most noble Felix , with all thankfulness .
Notwithstanding , that I be not further tedious unto thee , I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words .
For we have found this man a pestilent fellow , and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes :
Who also hath gone about to profane the temple : whom we took , and would have judged according to our law .
But the chief captain Lysias came upon us , and with great violence took him away out of our hands ,
Because that thou mayest understand , that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship .
And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man , neither raising up the people , neither in the synagogues , nor in the city :
Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me .
And have hope toward God , which they themselves also allow , that there shall be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
And herein do I exercise myself , to have always a conscience void of offence toward God , and toward men .
Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple , neither with multitude , nor with tumult .
Who ought to have been here before thee , and object , if they had ought against me .
Or else let these same here say , if they have found any evil doing in me , while I stood before the council ,
And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him .
And after certain days , when Felix came with his wife Drusilla , which was a Jewess , he sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ .
He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix ' room : and Felix , willing to shew the Jews a pleasure , left Paul bound .
Now when Festus was come into the province , after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem .
Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul , and besought him ,
And desired favour against him , that he would send for him to Jerusalem , laying wait in the way to kill him .
And when he had tarried among them more than ten days , he went down unto Caesarea ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought .
And when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus .
About whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , desiring to have judgment against him .
Against whom when the accusers stood up , they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed :
But had certain questions against him of their own superstition , and of one Jesus , which was dead , whom Paul affirmed to be alive .
And on the morrow , when Agrippa was come , and Bernice , with great pomp , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief captains , and principal men of the city , at Festus ' commandment Paul was brought forth .
But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death , and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus , I have determined to send him .
Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord . Wherefore I have brought him forth before you , and specially before thee , O king Agrippa , that , after examination had , I might have somewhat to write .
Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews : wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently .
Which knew me from the beginning , if they would testify , that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers :
Unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving God day and night , hope to come . For which hope 's sake , king Agrippa , I am accused of the Jews .
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you , that God should raise the dead ?
Which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
And I punished them oft in every synagogue , and compelled them to blaspheme ; and being exceedingly mad against them , I persecuted them even unto strange cities .
At midday , O king , I saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me .
But rise , and stand upon thy feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ;
Delivering thee from the people , and from the Gentiles , unto whom now I send thee ,
Having therefore obtained help of God , I continue unto this day , witnessing both to small and great , saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come :
For the king knoweth of these things , before whom also I speak freely : for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him ; for this thing was not done in a corner .
And when he had thus spoken , the king rose up , and the governor , and Bernice , and they that sat with them :
And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius , a centurion of Augustus ' band .
And entering into a ship of Adramyttium , we launched , meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia ; one Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
And the next day we touched at Sidon . And Julius courteously entreated Paul , and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself .
And when we had launched from thence , we sailed under Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy ; and he put us therein .
And when we had sailed slowly many days , and scarce were come over against Cnidus , the wind not suffering us , we sailed under Crete , over against Salmone ;
And , hardly passing it , came unto a place which is called The fair havens ; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea .
Now when much time was spent , and when sailing was now dangerous , because the fast was now already past , Paul admonished them ,
Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship , more than those things which were spoken by Paul .
And because the haven was not commodious to winter in , the more part advised to depart thence also , if by any means they might attain to Phenice , and there to winter ; which is an haven of Crete , and lieth toward the south west and north west .
But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind , called Euroclydon .
And when the ship was caught , and could not bear up into the wind , we let her drive .
And running under a certain island which is called Clauda , we had much work to come by the boat :
Which when they had taken up , they used helps , undergirding the ship ; and , fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands , strake sail , and so were driven .
And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest , the next day they lightened the ship ;
And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship .
And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small tempest lay on us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
And now I exhort you to be of good cheer : for there shall be no loss of any man 's life among you , but of the ship .
For there stood by me this night the angel of God , whose I am , and whom I serve ,
Wherefore , sirs , be of good cheer : for I believe God , that it shall be even as it was told me .
But when the fourteenth night was come , as we were driven up and down in Adria , about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country ;
And sounded , and found it twenty fathoms : and when they had gone a little further , they sounded again , and found it fifteen fathoms .
Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks , they cast four anchors out of the stern , and wished for the day .
And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship , when they had let down the boat into the sea , under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship ,
Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
And when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
Then were they all of good cheer , and they also took some meat .
And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls .
And when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
And when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain creek with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
And when they had taken up the anchors , they committed themselves unto the sea , and loosed the rudder bands , and hoised up the mainsail to the wind , and made toward shore .
And falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast , and remained unmoveable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves .
And the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
But the centurion , willing to save Paul , kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea , and get to land :
And the rest , some on boards , and some on broken pieces of the ship . And so it came to pass , that they escaped all safe to land .
And when they were escaped , then they knew that the island was called Melita .
And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness : for they kindled a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks , and laid them on the fire , there came a viper out of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
And he shook off the beast into the fire , and felt no harm .
In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island , whose name was Publius ; who received us , and lodged us three days courteously .
And it came to pass , that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom Paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
So when this was done , others also , which had diseases in the island , came , and were healed :
And landing at Syracuse , we tarried there three days .
And from thence we fetched a compass , and came to Rhegium : and after one day the south wind blew , and we came the next day to Puteoli :
Where we found brethren , and were desired to tarry with them seven days : and so we went toward Rome .
And from thence , when the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Appiiforum , and The three taverns : whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
And when we came to Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
Who , when they had examined me , would have let me go , because there was no cause of death in me .
But when the Jews spake against it , I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar ; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of .
And when they had appointed him a day , there came many to him into his lodging ; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God , persuading them concerning Jesus , both out of the law of Moses , and out of the prophets , from morning till evening .
And some believed the things which were spoken , and some believed not .
And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house , and received all that came in unto him ,
Preaching the kingdom of God , and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ , with all confidence , no man forbidding him .
Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , separated unto the gospel of God ,
( Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures , )
Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord , which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh ;
And declared to be the Son of God with power , according to the spirit of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead :
By whom we have received grace and apostleship , for obedience to the faith among all nations , for his name :
Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ :
To all that be in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
For I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established ;
That is , that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me .
Now I would not have you ignorant , brethren , that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you , ( but was let hitherto , ) that I might have some fruit among you also , even as among other Gentiles .
I am debtor both to the Greeks , and to the Barbarians ; both to the wise , and to the unwise .
So , as much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also .
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness ;
Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them ; for God hath shewed it unto them .
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse :
Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ,
And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and fourfooted beasts , and creeping things .
Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonour their own bodies between themselves :
Who changed the truth of God into a lie , and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator , who is blessed for ever . Amen .
For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature :
And likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ;
Being filled with all unrighteousness , fornication , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , debate , deceit , malignity ; whisperers ,
Backbiters , haters of God , despiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
Without understanding , covenantbreakers , without natural affection , implacable , unmerciful :
Who knowing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but have pleasure in them that do them .
Therefore thou art inexcusable , O man , whosoever thou art that judgest : for wherein thou judgest another , thou condemnest thyself ; for thou that judgest doest the same things .
But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things .
And thinkest thou this , O man , that judgest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering ; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance ?
Who will render to every man according to his deeds :
To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality , eternal life :
But unto them that are contentious , and do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , indignation and wrath ,
But glory , honour , and peace , to every man that worketh good , to the Jew first , and also to the Gentile :
For there is no respect of persons with God .
For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law : and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law ;
( For not the hearers of the law are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
For when the Gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves :
Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another ; )
In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel .
And knowest his will , and approvest the things that are more excellent , being instructed out of the law ;
And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
An instructor of the foolish , a teacher of babes , which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law .
Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? thou that preachest a man should not steal , dost thou steal ?
Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ?
Thou that makest thy boast of the law , through breaking the law dishonourest thou God ?
For circumcision verily profiteth , if thou keep the law : but if thou be a breaker of the law , thy circumcision is made uncircumcision .
Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law , shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision ?
And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge thee , who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law ?
For he is not a Jew , which is one outwardly ; neither is that circumcision , which is outward in the flesh :
What advantage then hath the Jew ? or what profit is there of circumcision ?
Much every way : chiefly , because that unto them were committed the oracles of God .
For what if some did not believe ? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect ?
But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance ? ( I speak as a man )
God forbid : for then how shall God judge the world ?
What then ? are we better than they ? No , in no wise : for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles , that they are all under sin ;
There is none that understandeth , there is none that seeketh after God .
Now we know that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight : for by the law is the knowledge of sin .
But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested , being witnessed by the law and the prophets ;
Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe : for there is no difference :
For all have sinned , and come short of the glory of God ;
Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus :
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God ;
To declare , I say , at this time his righteousness : that he might be just , and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus .
Where is boasting then ? It is excluded . By what law ? of works ? Nay : but by the law of faith .
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law .
Is he the God of the Jews only ? is he not also of the Gentiles ? Yes , of the Gentiles also :
Seeing it is one God , which shall justify the circumcision by faith , and uncircumcision through faith .
Do we then make void the law through faith ? God forbid : yea , we establish the law .
What shall we say then that Abraham our father , as pertaining to the flesh , hath found ?
For if Abraham were justified by works , he hath whereof to glory ; but not before God .
Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace , but of debt .
But to him that worketh not , but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly , his faith is counted for righteousness .
Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man , unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works ,
Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only , or upon the uncircumcision also ? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness .
How was it then reckoned ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
And he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised : that he might be the father of all them that believe , though they be not circumcised ; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also :
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet uncircumcised .
For the promise , that he should be the heir of the world , was not to Abraham , or to his seed , through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
For if they which are of the law be heirs , faith is made void , and the promise made of none effect :
Because the law worketh wrath : for where no law is , there is no transgression .
Therefore it is of faith , that it might be by grace ; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed ; not to that only which is of the law , but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham ; who is the father of us all ,
And being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the deadness of Sara 's womb :
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief ; but was strong in faith , giving glory to God ;
And being fully persuaded that , what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
But for us also , to whom it shall be imputed , if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead ;
Who was delivered for our offences , and was raised again for our justification .
Therefore being justified by faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ :
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
And not only so , but we glory in tribulations also : knowing that tribulation worketh patience ;
And patience , experience ; and experience , hope :
For when we were yet without strength , in due time Christ died for the ungodly .
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die : yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die .
But God commendeth his love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
Much more then , being now justified by his blood , we shall be saved from wrath through him .
For if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
And not only so , but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom we have now received the atonement .
Wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned :
( For until the law sin was in the world : but sin is not imputed when there is no law .
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam 's transgression , who is the figure of him that was to come .
But not as the offence , so also is the free gift . For if through the offence of one many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man , Jesus Christ , hath abounded unto many .
And not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .
For if by one man 's offence death reigned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ . )
Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation ; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life .
For as by one man 's disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous .
Moreover the law entered , that the offence might abound . But where sin abounded , grace did much more abound :
That as sin hath reigned unto death , even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord .
What shall we say then ? Shall we continue in sin , that grace may abound ?
God forbid . How shall we , that are dead to sin , live any longer therein ?
Know ye not , that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death ?
Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death , we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection :
Knowing this , that our old man is crucified with him , that the body of sin might be destroyed , that henceforth we should not serve sin .
For he that is dead is freed from sin .
Now if we be dead with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him :
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more ; death hath no more dominion over him .
For in that he died , he died unto sin once : but in that he liveth , he liveth unto God .
Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin , but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord .
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body , that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof .
Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin : but yield yourselves unto God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God .
What then ? shall we sin , because we are not under the law , but under grace ? God forbid .
Know ye not , that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey , his servants ye are to whom ye obey ; whether of sin unto death , or of obedience unto righteousness ?
Being then made free from sin , ye became the servants of righteousness .
I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh : for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity ; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness .
For when ye were the servants of sin , ye were free from righteousness .
What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
But now being made free from sin , and become servants to God , ye have your fruit unto holiness , and the end everlasting life .
For the wages of sin is death ; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
Know ye not , brethren , ( for I speak to them that know the law , ) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth ?
So then if , while her husband liveth , she be married to another man , she shall be called an adulteress : but if her husband be dead , she is free from that law ; so that she is no adulteress , though she be married to another man .
Wherefore , my brethren , ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ ; that ye should be married to another , even to him who is raised from the dead , that we should bring forth fruit unto God .
For when we were in the flesh , the motions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .
But now we are delivered from the law , that being dead wherein we were held ; that we should serve in newness of spirit , and not in the oldness of the letter .
But sin , taking occasion by the commandment , wrought in me all manner of concupiscence . For without the law sin was dead .
For I was alive without the law once : but when the commandment came , sin revived , and I died .
And the commandment , which was ordained to life , I found to be unto death .
For sin , taking occasion by the commandment , deceived me , and by it slew me .
Wherefore the law is holy , and the commandment holy , and just , and good .
Was then that which is good made death unto me ? God forbid . But sin , that it might appear sin , working death in me by that which is good ; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful .
For we know that the law is spiritual : but I am carnal , sold under sin .
For that which I do I allow not : for what I would , that do I not ; but what I hate , that do I.
If then I do that which I would not , I consent unto the law that it is good .
Now then it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
For I know that in me ( that is , in my flesh , ) dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .
For the good that I would I do not : but the evil which I would not , that I do .
Now if I do that I would not , it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
I find then a law , that , when I would do good , evil is present with me .
For I delight in the law of God after the inward man :
But I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord . So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God ; but with the flesh the law of sin .
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death .
For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit .
For to be carnally minded is death ; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace .
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God .
But ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
And if Christ be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
Therefore , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live after the flesh .
For if ye live after the flesh , ye shall die : but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body , ye shall live .
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God .
The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit , that we are the children of God :
For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God .
For the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope ,
Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God .
And not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
For we are saved by hope : but hope that is seen is not hope : for what a man seeth , why doth he yet hope for ?
But if we hope for that we see not , then do we with patience wait for it .
Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what we should pray for as we ought : but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered .
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God , to them who are the called according to his purpose .
For whom he did foreknow , he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
Moreover whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
What shall we then say to these things ? If God be for us , who can be against us ?
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God 's elect ? It is God that justifieth .
Who is he that condemneth ? It is Christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us .
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
Nay , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us .
I say the truth in Christ , I lie not , my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost ,
That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart .
For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren , my kinsmen according to the flesh :
Who are Israelites ; to whom pertaineth the adoption , and the glory , and the covenants , and the giving of the law , and the service of God , and the promises ;
Whose are the fathers , and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came , who is over all , God blessed for ever . Amen .
That is , They which are the children of the flesh , these are not the children of God : but the children of the promise are counted for the seed .
And not only this ; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one , even by our father Isaac ;
What shall we say then ? Is there unrighteousness with God ? God forbid .
So then it is not of him that willeth , nor of him that runneth , but of God that sheweth mercy .
Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy , and whom he will he hardeneth .
Hath not the potter power over the clay , of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour , and another unto dishonour ?
What if God , willing to shew his wrath , and to make his power known , endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction :
And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy , which he had afore prepared unto glory ,
Even us , whom he hath called , not of the Jews only , but also of the Gentiles ?
But Israel , which followed after the law of righteousness , hath not attained to the law of righteousness .
Wherefore ? Because they sought it not by faith , but as it were by the works of the law . For they stumbled at that stumblingstone ;
Brethren , my heart 's desire and prayer to God for Israel is , that they might be saved .
For they being ignorant of God 's righteousness , and going about to establish their own righteousness , have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God .
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth .
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
So then faith cometh by hearing , and hearing by the word of God .
God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew . Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias ? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel , saying ,
Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
And if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . But if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?
For I speak to you Gentiles , inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles , I magnify mine office :
If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh , and might save some of them .
For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
For if the firstfruit be holy , the lump is also holy : and if the root be holy , so are the branches .
And if some of the branches be broken off , and thou , being a wild olive tree , wert graffed in among them , and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree ;
Boast not against the branches . But if thou boast , thou bearest not the root , but the root thee .
Well ; because of unbelief they were broken off , and thou standest by faith . Be not highminded , but fear :
For if God spared not the natural branches , take heed lest he also spare not thee .
Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree : how much more shall these , which be the natural branches , be graffed into their own olive tree ?
As concerning the gospel , they are enemies for your sakes : but as touching the election , they are beloved for the fathers ' sakes .
For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance .
For as ye in times past have not believed God , yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief :
Even so have these also now not believed , that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy .
For God hath concluded them all in unbelief , that he might have mercy upon all .
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! how unsearchable are his judgments , and his ways past finding out !
For of him , and through him , and to him , are all things : to whom be glory for ever . Amen .
I beseech you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable unto God , which is your reasonable service .
And be not conformed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
For I say , through the grace given unto me , to every man that is among you , not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think ; but to think soberly , according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith .
For as we have many members in one body , and all members have not the same office :
So we , being many , are one body in Christ , and every one members one of another .
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us , whether prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith ;
Or ministry , let us wait on our ministering : or he that teacheth , on teaching ;
Let love be without dissimulation . Abhor that which is evil ; cleave to that which is good .
Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love ; in honour preferring one another ;
Not slothful in business ; fervent in spirit ; serving the Lord ;
Rejoicing in hope ; patient in tribulation ; continuing instant in prayer ;
Distributing to the necessity of saints ; given to hospitality .
Bless them which persecute you : bless , and curse not .
Be of the same mind one toward another . Mind not high things , but condescend to men of low estate . Be not wise in your own conceits .
Recompense to no man evil for evil . Provide things honest in the sight of all men .
If it be possible , as much as lieth in you , live peaceably with all men .
Be not overcome of evil , but overcome evil with good .
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers . For there is no power but of God : the powers that be are ordained of God .
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation .
For rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same :
For he is the minister of God to thee for good . But if thou do that which is evil , be afraid ; for he beareth not the sword in vain : for he is the minister of God , a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil .
Wherefore ye must needs be subject , not only for wrath , but also for conscience sake .
For for this cause pay ye tribute also : for they are God 's ministers , attending continually upon this very thing .
Render therefore to all their dues : tribute to whom tribute is due ; custom to whom custom ; fear to whom fear ; honour to whom honour .
Owe no man any thing , but to love one another : for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law .
And that , knowing the time , that now it is high time to awake out of sleep : for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed .
Let us walk honestly , as in the day ; not in rioting and drunkenness , not in chambering and wantonness , not in strife and envying .
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make not provision for the flesh , to fulfil the lusts thereof .
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye , but not to doubtful disputations .
For one believeth that he may eat all things : another , who is weak , eateth herbs .
Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not ; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth : for God hath received him .
Who art thou that judgest another man 's servant ? to his own master he standeth or falleth . Yea , he shall be holden up : for God is able to make him stand .
One man esteemeth one day above another : another esteemeth every day alike . Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind .
He that regardeth the day , regardeth it unto the Lord ; and he that regardeth not the day , to the Lord he doth not regard it . He that eateth , eateth to the Lord , for he giveth God thanks ; and he that eateth not , to the Lord he eateth not , and giveth God thanks .
For none of us liveth to himself , and no man dieth to himself .
For whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; and whether we die , we die unto the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
For to this end Christ both died , and rose , and revived , that he might be Lord both of the dead and living .
But why dost thou judge thy brother ? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God .
Let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother 's way .
I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing unclean of itself : but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat , now walkest thou not charitably . Destroy not him with thy meat , for whom Christ died .
Let not then your good be evil spoken of :
For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy Ghost .
For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God , and approved of men .
Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things wherewith one may edify another .
For meat destroy not the work of God . All things indeed are pure ; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence .
It is good neither to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth , or is offended , or is made weak .
Hast thou faith ? have it to thyself before God . Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth .
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat , because he eateth not of faith : for whatsoever is not of faith is sin .
We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak , and not to please ourselves .
Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification .
For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning , that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope .
Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus :
That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
Wherefore receive ye one another , as Christ also received us to the glory of God .
Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers :
Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Ghost .
And I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
Nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles , ministering the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Ghost .
I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God .
For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me , to make the Gentiles obedient , by word and deed ,
Through mighty signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit of God ; so that from Jerusalem , and round about unto Illyricum , I have fully preached the gospel of Christ .
Yea , so have I strived to preach the gospel , not where Christ was named , lest I should build upon another man 's foundation :
For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you .
But now having no more place in these parts , and having a great desire these many years to come unto you ;
Whensoever I take my journey into Spain , I will come to you : for I trust to see you in my journey , and to be brought on my way thitherward by you , if first I be somewhat filled with your company .
But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints .
For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem .
It hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
When therefore I have performed this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will come by you into Spain .
And I am sure that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
Now I beseech you , brethren , for the Lord Jesus Christ 's sake , and for the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ;
That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea ; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints ;
That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God , and may with you be refreshed .
Now the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
I commend unto you Phebe our sister , which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea :
That ye receive her in the Lord , as becometh saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succourer of many , and of myself also .
Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus :
Who have for my life laid down their own necks : unto whom not only I give thanks , but also all the churches of the Gentiles .
Likewise greet the church that is in their house . Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus , who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ .
Greet Mary , who bestowed much labour on us .
Salute Andronicus and Junia , my kinsmen , and my fellowprisoners , who are of note among the apostles , who also were in Christ before me .
Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord .
Salute Urbane , our helper in Christ , and Stachys my beloved .
Salute Apelles approved in Christ . Salute them which are of Aristobulus ' household .
Salute Herodion my kinsman . Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus , which are in the Lord .
Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa , who labour in the Lord . Salute the beloved Persis , which laboured much in the Lord .
Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord , and his mother and mine .
Salute Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermas , Patrobas , Hermes , and the brethren which are with them .
Salute Philologus , and Julia , Nereus , and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints which are with them .
Salute one another with an holy kiss . The churches of Christ salute you .
Now I beseech you , brethren , mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned ; and avoid them .
For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple .
For your obedience is come abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
Timotheus my workfellow , and Lucius , and Jason , and Sosipater , my kinsmen , salute you .
I Tertius , who wrote this epistle , salute you in the Lord .
Gaius mine host , and of the whole church , saluteth you . Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you , and Quartus a brother .
Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel , and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery , which was kept secret since the world began ,
But now is made manifest , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith :
To God only wise , be glory through Jesus Christ for ever . Amen .
Paul , called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , and Sosthenes our brother ,
Unto the church of God which is at Corinth , to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord , both theirs and ours :
Grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
I thank my God always on your behalf , for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ ;
That in every thing ye are enriched by him , in all utterance , and in all knowledge ;
Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you :
So that ye come behind in no gift ; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ :
Who shall also confirm you unto the end , that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
God is faithful , by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord .
Now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
For it hath been declared unto me of you , my brethren , by them which are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
Is Christ divided ? was Paul crucified for you ? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul ?
I thank God that I baptized none of you , but Crispus and Gaius ;
Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name .
And I baptized also the household of Stephanas : besides , I know not whether I baptized any other .
For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel : not with wisdom of words , lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect .
For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God .
Where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the disputer of this world ? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
For the Jews require a sign , and the Greeks seek after wisdom :
But unto them which are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God .
Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men ; and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
For ye see your calling , brethren , how that not many wise men after the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble , are called :
But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise ; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty ;
And base things of the world , and things which are despised , hath God chosen , yea , and things which are not , to bring to nought things that are :
That no flesh should glory in his presence .
But of him are ye in Christ Jesus , who of God is made unto us wisdom , and righteousness , and sanctification , and redemption :
And I , brethren , when I came to you , came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of God .
For I determined not to know any thing among you , save Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
And I was with you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man 's wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power :
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect : yet not the wisdom of this world , nor of the princes of this world , that come to nought :
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom , which God ordained before the world unto our glory :
Which none of the princes of this world knew : for had they known it , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit : for the Spirit searcheth all things , yea , the deep things of God .
Now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
Which things also we speak , not in the words which man 's wisdom teacheth , but which the Holy Ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God : for they are foolishness unto him : neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
And I , brethren , could not speak unto you as unto spiritual , but as unto carnal , even as unto babes in Christ .
I have fed you with milk , and not with meat : for hitherto ye were not able to bear it , neither yet now are ye able .
For ye are yet carnal : for whereas there is among you envying , and strife , and divisions , are ye not carnal , and walk as men ?
Who then is Paul , and who is Apollos , but ministers by whom ye believed , even as the Lord gave to every man ?
I have planted , Apollos watered ; but God gave the increase .
So then neither is he that planteth any thing , neither he that watereth ; but God that giveth the increase .
Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one : and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour .
For we are labourers together with God : ye are God 's husbandry , ye are God 's building .
According to the grace of God which is given unto me , as a wise masterbuilder , I have laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon . But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon .
For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
Now if any man build upon this foundation gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , stubble ;
Every man 's work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is .
If any man 's work abide which he hath built thereupon , he shall receive a reward .
If any man 's work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be saved ; yet so as by fire .
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
If any man defile the temple of God , him shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy , which temple ye are .
Let no man deceive himself . If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
Therefore let no man glory in men . For all things are yours ;
And ye are Christ 's ; and Christ is God 's .
Moreover it is required in stewards , that a man be found faithful .
But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you , or of man 's judgment : yea , I judge not mine own self .
For I know nothing by myself ; yet am I not hereby justified : but he that judgeth me is the Lord .
Therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord come , who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts : and then shall every man have praise of God .
For who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
Now ye are full , now ye are rich , ye have reigned as kings without us : and I would to God ye did reign , that we also might reign with you .
For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last , as it were appointed to death : for we are made a spectacle unto the world , and to angels , and to men .
We are fools for Christ 's sake , but ye are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are honourable , but we are despised .
Even unto this present hour we both hunger , and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and have no certain dwellingplace ;
And labour , working with our own hands : being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer it :
Being defamed , we intreat : we are made as the filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day .
I write not these things to shame you , but as my beloved sons I warn you .
For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet have ye not many fathers : for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel .
Wherefore I beseech you , be ye followers of me .
For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus , who is my beloved son , and faithful in the Lord , who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ , as I teach every where in every church .
Now some are puffed up , as though I would not come to you .
But I will come to you shortly , if the Lord will , and will know , not the speech of them which are puffed up , but the power .
For the kingdom of God is not in word , but in power .
It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you , and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles , that one should have his father 's wife .
And ye are puffed up , and have not rather mourned , that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you .
For I verily , as absent in body , but present in spirit , have judged already , as though I were present , concerning him that hath so done this deed ,
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , when ye are gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
Purge out therefore the old leaven , that ye may be a new lump , as ye are unleavened . For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us :
Therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators :
Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
But now I have written unto you not to keep company , if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator , or covetous , or an idolater , or a railer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner ; with such an one no not to eat .
Dare any of you , having a matter against another , go to law before the unjust , and not before the saints ?
Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be judged by you , are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
Know ye not that we shall judge angels ? how much more things that pertain to this life ?
If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life , set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church .
I speak to your shame . Is it so , that there is not a wise man among you ? no , not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren ?
But brother goeth to law with brother , and that before the unbelievers .
Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you , because ye go to law one with another . Why do ye not rather take wrong ? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded ?
Nay , ye do wrong , and defraud , and that your brethren .
And such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
And God hath both raised up the Lord , and will also raise up us by his own power .
Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbid .
But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit .
Flee fornication . Every sin that a man doeth is without the body ; but he that commiteth fornication sinneth against his own body .
What ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
For ye are bought with a price : therefore glorify God in your body , and in your spirit , which are God 's .
Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me : It is good for a man not to touch a woman .
Nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence : and likewise also the wife unto the husband .
The wife hath not power of her own body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body , but the wife .
Defraud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency .
But I speak this by permission , and not of commandment .
For I would that all men were even as I myself . But every man hath his proper gift of God , one after this manner , and another after that .
But if they cannot contain , let them marry : for it is better to marry than to burn .
And unto the married I command , yet not I , but the Lord , Let not the wife depart from her husband :
But and if she depart , let her remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
But to the rest speak I , not the Lord : If any brother hath a wife that believeth not , and she be pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not , and if he be pleased to dwell with her , let her not leave him .
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband : else were your children unclean ; but now are they holy .
But if the unbelieving depart , let him depart . A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases : but God hath called us to peace .
But as God hath distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every one , so let him walk . And so ordain I in all churches .
Is any man called being circumcised ? let him not become uncircumcised . Is any called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God .
Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called .
Art thou called being a servant ? care not for it : but if thou mayest be made free , use it rather .
For he that is called in the Lord , being a servant , is the Lord 's freeman : likewise also he that is called , being free , is Christ 's servant .
Ye are bought with a price ; be not ye the servants of men .
Brethren , let every man , wherein he is called , therein abide with God .
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord : yet I give my judgment , as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful .
I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress , I say , that it is good for a man so to be .
Art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loosed . Art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
But and if thou marry , thou hast not sinned ; and if a virgin marry , she hath not sinned . Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh : but I spare you .
And they that weep , as though they wept not ; and they that rejoice , as though they rejoiced not ; and they that buy , as though they possessed not ;
And they that use this world , as not abusing it : for the fashion of this world passeth away .
But I would have you without carefulness . He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord , how he may please the Lord :
But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
There is difference also between a wife and a virgin . The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit : but she that is married careth for the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
And this I speak for your own profit ; not that I may cast a snare upon you , but for that which is comely , and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction .
But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin , if she pass the flower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sinneth not : let them marry .
Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin , doeth well .
So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well ; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better .
The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
But she is happier if she so abide , after my judgment : and I think also that I have the Spirit of God .
And if any man think that he knoweth anything , he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know .
But if any man love God , the same is known of him .
But to us there is but one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we in him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , by whom are all things , and we by him .
Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge : for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol ; and their conscience being weak is defiled .
But meat commendeth us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak .
For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol 's temple , shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols ;
And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish , for whom Christ died ?
But when ye sin so against the brethren , and wound their weak conscience , ye sin against Christ .
Wherefore , if meat make my brother to offend , I will eat no flesh while the world standeth , lest I make my brother to offend .
Am I not an apostle ? am I not free ? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord ? are not ye my work in the Lord ?
If I be not an apostle unto others , yet doubtless I am to you : for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord .
Have we not power to eat and to drink ?
Have we not power to lead about a sister , a wife , as well as other apostles , and as the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
Or I only and Barnabas , have not we power to forbear working ?
Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
Say I these things as a man ? or saith not the law the same also ?
Or saith he it altogether for our sakes ? For our sakes , no doubt , this is written : that he that ploweth should plow in hope ; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope .
If we have sown unto you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things ?
If others be partakers of this power over you , are not we rather ? Nevertheless we have not used this power ; but suffer all things , lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ .
Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple ? and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter ?
Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel .
But I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
For though I preach the gospel , I have nothing to glory of : for necessity is laid upon me ; yea , woe is unto me , if I preach not the gospel !
For if I do this thing willingly , I have a reward : but if against my will , a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me .
For though I be free from all men , yet have I made myself servant unto all , that I might gain the more .
And unto the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ;
To them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
To the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
And this I do for the gospel 's sake , that I might be partaker thereof with you .
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? So run , that ye may obtain .
And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things . Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown ; but we an incorruptible .
I therefore so run , not as uncertainly ; so fight I , not as one that beateth the air :
But I keep under my body , and bring it into subjection : lest that by any means , when I have preached to others , I myself should be a castaway .
Moreover , brethren , I would not that ye should be ignorant , how that all our fathers were under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ;
And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
And did all eat the same spiritual meat ;
And did all drink the same spiritual drink : for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them : and that Rock was Christ .
But with many of them God was not well pleased : for they were overthrown in the wilderness .
Now these things were our examples , to the intent we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted .
Neither let us commit fornication , as some of them committed , and fell in one day three and twenty thousand .
Neither let us tempt Christ , as some of them also tempted , and were destroyed of serpents .
Neither murmur ye , as some of them also murmured , and were destroyed of the destroyer .
Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples : and they are written for our admonition , upon whom the ends of the world are come .
Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall .
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man : but God is faithful , who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able ; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape , that ye may be able to bear it .
Wherefore , my dearly beloved , flee from idolatry .
The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
For we being many are one bread , and one body : for we are all partakers of that one bread .
Behold Israel after the flesh : are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the alter ?
What say I then ? that the idol is any thing , or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing ?
But I say , that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to God : and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils .
Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord , and the cup of devils : ye cannot be partakers of the Lord 's table , and of the table of devils .
Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? are we stronger than he ?
Let no man seek his own , but every man another 's wealth .
Whatsoever is sold in the shambles , that eat , asking no question for conscience sake :
If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake .
Conscience , I say , not thine own , but of the other : for why is my liberty judged of another man 's conscience ?
For if I by grace be a partaker , why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks ?
Whether therefore ye eat , or drink , or whatsoever ye do , do all to the glory of God .
Give none offence , neither to the Jews , nor to the Gentiles , nor to the church of God :
Even as I please all men in all things , not seeking mine own profit , but the profit of many , that they may be saved .
Be ye followers of me , even as I also am of Christ .
Now I praise you , brethren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ordinances , as I delivered them to you .
Every man praying or prophesying , having his head covered , dishonoureth his head .
But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head : for that is even all one as if she were shaven .
For if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered .
For a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
For the man is not of the woman ; but the woman of the man .
Neither was the man created for the woman ; but the woman for the man .
For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels .
Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman , neither the woman without the man , in the Lord .
For as the woman is of the man , even so is the man also by the woman ; but all things of god .
Doth not even nature itself teach you , that , if a man have long hair , it is a shame unto him ?
But if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her : for her hair is given her for a covering .
But if any man seem to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither the churches of God .
Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
For first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there be divisions among you ; and I partly believe it .
For there must be also heresies among you , that they which are approved may be made manifest among you .
When ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the Lord 's supper .
For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper : and one is hungry , and another is drunken .
What ? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ? or despise ye the church of God , and shame them that have not ? What shall I say to you ? shall I praise you in this ? I praise you not .
For as often as ye eat this bread , and drink this cup , ye do shew the Lord 's death till he come .
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
But let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation to himself , not discerning the Lord 's body .
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you , and many sleep .
For if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
But when we are judged , we are chastened of the Lord , that we should not be condemned with the world .
Wherefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , tarry one for another .
And if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together unto condemnation . And the rest will I set in order when I come .
Now concerning spiritual gifts , brethren , I would not have you ignorant .
Ye know that ye were Gentiles , carried away unto these dumb idols , even as ye were led .
Now there are diversities of gifts , but the same Spirit .
And there are differences of administrations , but the same Lord .
And there are diversities of operations , but it is the same God which worketh all in all .
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal .
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom ; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit ;
To another faith by the same Spirit ; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit ;
To another the working of miracles ; to another prophecy ; to another discerning of spirits ; to another divers kinds of tongues ; to another the interpretation of tongues :
But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit , dividing to every man severally as he will .
For the body is not one member , but many .
If the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ?
But now are they many members , yet but one body .
Nay , much more those members of the body , which seem to be more feeble , are necessary :
And those members of the body , which we think to be less honourable , upon these we bestow more abundant honour ; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness .
For our comely parts have no need : but God hath tempered the body together , having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked :
That there should be no schism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
And whether one member suffer , all the members suffer with it ; or one member be honoured , all the members rejoice with it .
Now ye are the body of Christ , and members in particular .
And God hath set some in the church , first apostles , secondarily prophets , thirdly teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helps , governments , diversities of tongues .
Are all apostles ? are all prophets ? are all teachers ? are all workers of miracles ?
Have all the gifts of healing ? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret ?
But covet earnestly the best gifts : and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way .
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , and have not charity , I am become as sounding brass , or a tinkling cymbal .
And though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries , and all knowledge ; and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity , I am nothing .
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing .
Charity suffereth long , and is kind ; charity envieth not ; charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up ,
Doth not behave itself unseemly , seeketh not her own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil ;
Rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth in the truth ;
Beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things .
Charity never faileth : but whether there be prophecies , they shall fail ; whether there be tongues , they shall cease ; whether there be knowledge , it shall vanish away .
For we know in part , and we prophesy in part .
But when that which is perfect is come , then that which is in part shall be done away .
For now we see through a glass , darkly ; but then face to face : now I know in part ; but then shall I know even as also I am known .
And now abideth faith , hope , charity , these three ; but the greatest of these is charity .
Follow after charity , and desire spiritual gifts , but rather that ye may prophesy .
But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification , and exhortation , and comfort .
He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself ; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church .
I would that ye all spake with tongues , but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
Now , brethren , if I come unto you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speak to you either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
And even things without life giving sound , whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself to the battle ?
So likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
There are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signification .
Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian , and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me .
Even so ye , forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts , seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church .
Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret .
For if I pray in an unknown tongue , my spirit prayeth , but my understanding is unfruitful .
What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
For thou verily givest thanks well , but the other is not edified .
I thank my God , I speak with tongues more than ye all :
Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
Brethren , be not children in understanding : howbeit in malice be ye children , but in understanding be men .
If therefore the whole church be come together into one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in those that are unlearned , or unbelievers , will they not say that ye are mad ?
But if all prophesy , and there come in one that believeth not , or one unlearned , he is convinced of all , he is judged of all :
How is it then , brethren ? when ye come together , everyone of you hath a psalm , hath a doctrine , hath a tongue , hath a revelation , hath an interpretation . Let all things be done unto edifying .
If any man speak in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpret .
But if there be no interpreter , let him keep silence in the church ; and let him speak to himself , and to God .
Let the prophets speak two or three , and let the other judge .
If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
For ye may all prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be comforted .
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets .
For God is not the author of confusion , but of peace , as in all churches of the saints .
Let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
And if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
What ? came the word of God out from you ? or came it unto you only ?
If any man think himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord .
But if any man be ignorant , let him be ignorant .
Wherefore , brethren , covet to prophesy , and forbid not to speak with tongues .
Let all things be done decently and in order .
Moreover , brethren , I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you , which also ye have received , and wherein ye stand ;
By which also ye are saved , if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you , unless ye have believed in vain .
And that he was seen of Cephas , then of the twelve :
After that , he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once ; of whom the greater part remain unto this present , but some are fallen asleep .
And last of all he was seen of me also , as of one born out of due time .
For I am the least of the apostles , that am not meet to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
But by the grace of God I am what I am : and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ; but I laboured more abundantly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
Therefore whether it were I or they , so we preach , and so ye believed .
Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead , how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
But if there be no resurrection of the dead , then is Christ not risen :
And if Christ be not risen , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is also vain .
Yea , and we are found false witnesses of God ; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ : whom he raised not up , if so be that the dead rise not .
For if the dead rise not , then is not Christ raised :
And if Christ be not raised , your faith is vain ; ye are yet in your sins .
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished .
If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men most miserable .
But now is Christ risen from the dead , and become the firstfruits of them that slept .
For since by man came death , by man came also the resurrection of the dead .
For as in Adam all die , even so in Christ shall all be made alive .
But every man in his own order : Christ the firstfruits ; afterward they that are Christ 's at his coming .
Then cometh the end , when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power .
For he must reign , till he hath put all enemies under his feet .
The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death .
And when all things shall be subdued unto him , then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him , that God may be all in all .
Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not at all ? why are they then baptized for the dead ?
And why stand we in jeopardy every hour ?
I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die daily .
Awake to righteousness , and sin not ; for some have not the knowledge of God : I speak this to your shame .
Thou fool , that which thou sowest is not quickened , except it die :
But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him , and to every seed his own body .
There are also celestial bodies , and bodies terrestrial : but the glory of the celestial is one , and the glory of the terrestrial is another .
There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars : for one star differeth from another star in glory .
It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . There is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body .
Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual , but that which is natural ; and afterward that which is spiritual .
The first man is of the earth , earthy : the second man is the Lord from heaven .
As is the earthy , such are they also that are earthy : and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
And as we have borne the image of the earthy , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly .
Now this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption .
In a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trump : for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
For this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality .
The sting of death is sin ; and the strength of sin is the law .
But thanks be to God , which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
Therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye stedfast , unmoveable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord .
Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store , as God hath prospered him , that there be no gatherings when I come .
And when I come , whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters , them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem .
And if it be meet that I go also , they shall go with me .
Now I will come unto you , when I shall pass through Macedonia : for I do pass through Macedonia .
And it may be that I will abide , yea , and winter with you , that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go .
For I will not see you now by the way ; but I trust to tarry a while with you , if the Lord permit .
But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost .
For a great door and effectual is opened unto me , and there are many adversaries .
Now if Timotheus come , see that he may be with you without fear : for he worketh the work of the Lord , as I also do .
Let no man therefore despise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come unto me : for I look for him with the brethren .
Watch ye , stand fast in the faith , quit you like men , be strong .
Let all your things be done with charity .
I beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Stephanas , that it is the firstfruits of Achaia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
That ye submit yourselves unto such , and to every one that helpeth with us , and laboureth .
I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus : for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied .
For they have refreshed my spirit and yours : therefore acknowledge ye them that are such .
The churches of Asia salute you . Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
All the brethren greet you . Greet ye one another with an holy kiss .
The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand .
If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ , let him be Anathema Maranatha .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen .
Grace be to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
Blessed be God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies , and the God of all comfort ;
Who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ .
And whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
For we would not , brethren , have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia , that we were pressed out of measure , above strength , insomuch that we despaired even of life :
But we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God which raiseth the dead :
Who delivered us from so great a death , and doth deliver : in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us ;
Ye also helping together by prayer for us , that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf .
For our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly to you-ward .
For we write none other things unto you , than what ye read or acknowledge ; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end ;
As also ye have acknowledged us in part , that we are your rejoicing , even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus .
And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before , that ye might have a second benefit ;
And to pass by you into Macedonia , and to come again out of Macedonia unto you , and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea .
Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ , and hath anointed us , is God ;
Who hath also sealed us , and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts .
Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul , that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth .
Not for that we have dominion over your faith , but are helpers of your joy : for by faith ye stand .
But I determined this with myself , that I would not come again to you in heaviness .
For if I make you sorry , who is he then that maketh me glad , but the same which is made sorry by me ?
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears ; not that ye should be grieved , but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you .
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment , which was inflicted of many .
So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him , and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow .
Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him .
For to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
To whom ye forgive any thing , I forgive also : for if I forgave any thing , to whom I forgave it , for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ ;
Lest Satan should get an advantage of us : for we are not ignorant of his devices .
Furthermore , when I came to Troas to preach Christ 's gospel , and a door was opened unto me of the Lord ,
I had no rest in my spirit , because I found not Titus my brother : but taking my leave of them , I went from thence into Macedonia .
Now thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place .
For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ , in them that are saved , and in them that perish :
To the one we are the savour of death unto death ; and to the other the savour of life unto life . And who is sufficient for these things ?
For we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
Do we begin again to commend ourselves ? or need we , as some others , epistles of commendation to you , or letters of commendation from you ?
Ye are our epistle written in our hearts , known and read of all men :
And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward :
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our sufficiency is of God ;
Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament ; not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life .
But if the ministration of death , written and engraven in stones , was glorious , so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance ; which glory was to be done away :
How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious ?
For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the glory that excelleth .
For if that which is done away was glorious , much more that which remaineth is glorious .
Seeing then that we have such hope , we use great plainness of speech :
And not as Moses , which put a vail over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished :
But their minds were blinded : for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament ; which vail is done away in Christ .
But even unto this day , when Moses is read , the vail is upon their heart .
Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord , the vail shall be taken away .
Now the Lord is that Spirit : and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .
But we all , with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord .
Therefore seeing we have this ministry , as we have received mercy , we faint not ;
But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
But if our gospel be hid , it is hid to them that are lost :
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us .
We are troubled on every side , yet not distressed ; we are perplexed , but not in despair ;
Persecuted , but not forsaken ; cast down , but not destroyed ;
Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body .
For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh .
So then death worketh in us , but life in you .
Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus , and shall present us with you .
For all things are for your sakes , that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God .
For which cause we faint not ; but though our outward man perish , yet the inward man is renewed day by day .
For our light affliction , which is but for a moment , worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory ;
While we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which are not seen are eternal .
For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved , we have a building of God , an house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens .
For in this we groan , earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven :
If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked .
For we that are in this tabernacle do groan , being burdened : not for that we would be unclothed , but clothed upon , that mortality might be swallowed up of life .
Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God , who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit .
Therefore we are always confident , knowing that , whilst we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord :
( For we walk by faith , not by sight : )
We are confident , I say , and willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be present with the Lord .
Wherefore we labour , that , whether present or absent , we may be accepted of him .
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God ; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences .
For we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
For whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
For the love of Christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead :
And that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh : yea , though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now henceforth know we him no more .
Therefore if any man be in Christ , he is a new creature : old things are passed away ; behold , all things are become new .
And all things are of God , who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ , and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
To wit , that God was in Christ , reconciling the world unto himself , not imputing their trespasses unto them ; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation .
Now then we are ambassadors for Christ , as though God did beseech you by us : we pray you in Christ 's stead , be ye reconciled to God .
For he hath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him .
We then , as workers together with him , beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain .
Giving no offence in any thing , that the ministry be not blamed :
In stripes , in imprisonments , in tumults , in labours , in watchings , in fastings ;
By pureness , by knowledge , by longsuffering , by kindness , by the Holy Ghost , by love unfeigned ,
By the word of truth , by the power of God , by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left ,
By honour and dishonour , by evil report and good report : as deceivers , and yet true ;
As sorrowful , yet alway rejoicing ; as poor , yet making many rich ; as having nothing , and yet possessing all things .
O ye Corinthians , our mouth is open unto you , our heart is enlarged .
Ye are not straitened in us , but ye are straitened in your own bowels .
Now for a recompence in the same , ( I speak as unto my children , ) be ye also enlarged .
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers : for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness ? and what communion hath light with darkness ?
And what concord hath Christ with Belial ? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel ?
Having therefore these promises , dearly beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of God .
Receive us ; we have wronged no man , we have corrupted no man , we have defrauded no man .
I speak not this to condemn you : for I have said before , that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you .
Great is my boldness of speech toward you , great is my glorying of you : I am filled with comfort , I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation .
For , when we were come into Macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we were troubled on every side ; without were fightings , within were fears .
Nevertheless God , that comforteth those that are cast down , comforted us by the coming of Titus ;
And not by his coming only , but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you , when he told us your earnest desire , your mourning , your fervent mind toward me ; so that I rejoiced the more .
For though I made you sorry with a letter , I do not repent , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry , though it were but for a season .
Now I rejoice , not that ye were made sorry , but that ye sorrowed to repentance : for ye were made sorry after a godly manner , that ye might receive damage by us in nothing .
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of : but the sorrow of the world worketh death .
Wherefore , though I wrote unto you , I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered wrong , but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you .
Therefore we were comforted in your comfort : yea , and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
For if I have boasted any thing to him of you , I am not ashamed ; but as we spake all things to you in truth , even so our boasting , which I made before Titus , is found a truth .
And his inward affection is more abundant toward you , whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling ye received him .
I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things .
Moreover , brethren , we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia ;
How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality .
For to their power , I bear record , yea , and beyond their power they were willing of themselves ;
Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift , and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints .
And this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the Lord , and unto us by the will of God .
Insomuch that we desired Titus , that as he had begun , so he would also finish in you the same grace also .
Therefore , as ye abound in every thing , in faith , and utterance , and knowledge , and in all diligence , and in your love to us , see that ye abound in this grace also .
I speak not by commandment , but by occasion of the forwardness of others , and to prove the sincerity of your love .
And herein I give my advice : for this is expedient for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
For if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not .
For I mean not that other men be eased , and ye burdened :
But by an equality , that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want , that their abundance also may be a supply for your want : that there may be equality :
But thanks be to God , which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you .
For indeed he accepted the exhortation ; but being more forward , of his own accord he went unto you .
And we have sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches ;
And not that only , but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace , which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord , and declaration of your ready mind :
Avoiding this , that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us :
Providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
And we have sent with them our brother , whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
Whether any do inquire of Titus , he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you : or our brethren be inquired of , they are the messengers of the churches , and the glory of Christ .
Wherefore shew ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf .
For as touching the ministering to the saints , it is superfluous for me to write to you :
For I know the forwardness of your mind , for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia , that Achaia was ready a year ago ; and your zeal hath provoked very many .
Yet have I sent the brethren , lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf ; that , as I said , ye may be ready :
Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me , and find you unprepared , we ( that we say not , ye ) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting .
But this I say , He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully .
Every man according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him give ; not grudgingly , or of necessity : for God loveth a cheerful giver .
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you ; that ye , always having all sufficiency in all things , may abound to every good work :
Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food , and multiply your seed sown , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ; )
Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness , which causeth through us thanksgiving to God .
For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints , but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God ;
And by their prayer for you , which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you .
Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift .
Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ , who in presence am base among you , but being absent am bold toward you :
But I beseech you , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence , wherewith I think to be bold against some , which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
For though we walk in the flesh , we do not war after the flesh :
( For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal , but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds ; )
Casting down imaginations , and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God , and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ ;
And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience , when your obedience is fulfilled .
Do ye look on things after the outward appearance ? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ 's , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is Christ 's , even so are we Christ 's .
For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority , which the Lord hath given us for edification , and not for your destruction , I should not be ashamed :
That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters .
For we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
But we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as though we reached not unto you : for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ :
Not boasting of things without our measure , that is , of other men 's labours ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly ,
To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you , and not to boast in another man 's line of things made ready to our hand .
For not he that commendeth himself is approved , but whom the Lord commendeth .
Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly : and indeed bear with me .
For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy : for I have espoused you to one husband , that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
But I fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus , whom we have not preached , or if ye receive another spirit , which ye have not received , or another gospel , which ye have not accepted , ye might well bear with him .
But though I be rude in speech , yet not in knowledge ; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things .
Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted , because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely ?
I robbed other churches , taking wages of them , to do you service .
And when I was present with you , and wanted , I was chargeable to no man : for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied : and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you , and so will I keep myself .
As the truth of Christ is in me , no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
Wherefore ? because I love you not ? God knoweth .
But what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
For such are false apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ .
And no marvel ; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light .
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
That which I speak , I speak it not after the Lord , but as it were foolishly , in this confidence of boasting .
Seeing that many glory after the flesh , I will glory also .
For ye suffer fools gladly , seeing ye yourselves are wise .
For ye suffer , if a man bring you into bondage , if a man devour you , if a man take of you , if a man exalt himself , if a man smite you on the face .
Are they Hebrews ? so am I. Are they Israelites ? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I.
Are they ministers of Christ ? ( I speak as a fool ) I am more ; in labours more abundant , in stripes above measure , in prisons more frequent , in deaths oft .
Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one .
Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned , thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day I have been in the deep ;
In journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ;
In weariness and painfulness , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness .
Beside those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches .
Who is weak , and I am not weak ? who is offended , and I burn not ?
If I must needs glory , I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities .
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which is blessed for evermore , knoweth that I lie not .
In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison , desirous to apprehend me :
And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall , and escaped his hands .
It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory . I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago , ( whether in the body , I cannot tell ; or whether out of the body , I cannot tell : God knoweth ; ) such an one caught up to the third heaven .
Of such an one will I glory : yet of myself I will not glory , but in mine infirmities .
For though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or that he heareth of me .
And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , the messenger of Satan to buffet me , lest I should be exalted above measure .
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice , that it might depart from me .
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities , in reproaches , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses for Christ 's sake : for when I am weak , then am I strong .
Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience , in signs , and wonders , and mighty deeds .
For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches , except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you ? forgive me this wrong .
Behold , the third time I am ready to come to you ; and I will not be burdensome to you : for I seek not yours , but you : for the children ought not to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you ; though the more abundantly I love you , the less I be loved .
But be it so , I did not burden you : nevertheless , being crafty , I caught you with guile .
Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you ?
I desired Titus , and with him I sent a brother . Did Titus make a gain of you ? walked we not in the same spirit ? walked we not in the same steps ?
Again , think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you ? we speak before God in Christ : but we do all things , dearly beloved , for your edifying .
For I fear , lest , when I come , I shall not find you such as I would , and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not : lest there be debates , envyings , wraths , strifes , backbitings , whisperings , swellings , tumults :
And lest , when I come again , my God will humble me among you , and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already , and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed .
Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me , which to you-ward is not weak , but is mighty in you .
For though he was crucified through weakness , yet he liveth by the power of God . For we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
Examine yourselves , whether ye be in the faith ; prove your own selves . Know ye not your own selves , how that Jesus Christ is in you , except ye be reprobates ?
But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates .
Now I pray to God that ye do no evil ; not that we should appear approved , but that ye should do that which is honest , though we be as reprobates .
For we can do nothing against the truth , but for the truth .
For we are glad , when we are weak , and ye are strong : and this also we wish , even your perfection .
Therefore I write these things being absent , lest being present I should use sharpness , according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification , and not to destruction .
Finally , brethren , farewell . Be perfect , be of good comfort , be of one mind , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace shall be with you .
Greet one another with an holy kiss .
All the saints salute you .
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the communion of the Holy Ghost , be with you all . Amen .
Paul , an apostle , ( not of men , neither by man , but by Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ; )
And all the brethren which are with me , unto the churches of Galatia :
Grace be to you and peace from God the Father , and from our Lord Jesus Christ ,
Who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us from this present evil world , according to the will of God and our Father :
To whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel :
Which is not another ; but there be some that trouble you , and would pervert the gospel of Christ .
But though we , or an angel from heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accursed .
For do I now persuade men , or God ? or do I seek to please men ? for if I yet pleased men , I should not be the servant of Christ .
But I certify you , brethren , that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man .
For I neither received it of man , neither was I taught it , but by the revelation of Jesus Christ .
For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
And profited in the Jews ' religion above many my equals in mine own nation , being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers .
But when it pleased God , who separated me from my mother 's womb , and called me by his grace ,
To reveal his Son in me , that I might preach him among the heathen ; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood :
Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me ; but I went into Arabia , and returned again unto Damascus .
But other of the apostles saw I none , save James the Lord 's brother .
Now the things which I write unto you , behold , before God , I lie not .
Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia ;
And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ :
And they glorified God in me .
Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , and took Titus with me also .
And I went up by revelation , and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles , but privately to them which were of reputation , lest by any means I should run , or had run , in vain .
To whom we gave place by subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
But contrariwise , when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me , as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter ;
( For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles : )
Only they would that we should remember the poor ; the same which I also was forward to do .
But when Peter was come to Antioch , I withstood him to the face , because he was to be blamed .
And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him ; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation .
We who are Jews by nature , and not sinners of the Gentiles ,
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law , but by the faith of Jesus Christ , even we have believed in Jesus Christ , that we might be justified by the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the law : for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified .
But if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ? God forbid .
For if I build again the things which I destroyed , I make myself a transgressor .
For I through the law am dead to the law , that I might live unto God .
I am crucified with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me : and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me .
I do not frustrate the grace of God : for if righteousness come by the law , then Christ is dead in vain .
O foolish Galatians , who hath bewitched you , that ye should not obey the truth , before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth , crucified among you ?
Are ye so foolish ? having begun in the Spirit , are ye now made perfect by the flesh ?
Have ye suffered so many things in vain ? if it be yet in vain .
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit , and worketh miracles among you , doeth he it by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith , the same are the children of Abraham .
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham .
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
For if the inheritance be of the law , it is no more of promise : but God gave it to Abraham by promise .
Wherefore then serveth the law ? It was added because of transgressions , till the seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator .
Now a mediator is not a mediator of one , but God is one .
Is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
But the scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe .
But before faith came , we were kept under the law , shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
But after that faith is come , we are no longer under a schoolmaster .
There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither bond nor free , there is neither male nor female : for ye are all one in Christ Jesus .
And if ye be Christ 's , then are ye Abraham 's seed , and heirs according to the promise .
But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father .
Even so we , when we were children , were in bondage under the elements of the world :
But when the fulness of the time was come , God sent forth his Son , made of a woman , made under the law ,
To redeem them that were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons .
Wherefore thou art no more a servant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir of God through Christ .
Howbeit then , when ye knew not God , ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods .
But now , after that ye have known God , or rather are known of God , how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements , whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage ?
Ye observe days , and months , and times , and years .
I am afraid of you , lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain .
Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first .
And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not , nor rejected ; but received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
Where is then the blessedness ye spake of ? for I bear you record , that , if it had been possible , ye would have plucked out your own eyes , and have given them to me .
Am I therefore become your enemy , because I tell you the truth ?
They zealously affect you , but not well ; yea , they would exclude you , that ye might affect them .
But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing , and not only when I am present with you .
My little children , of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you ,
I desire to be present with you now , and to change my voice ; for I stand in doubt of you .
Tell me , ye that desire to be under the law , do ye not hear the law ?
For it is written , that Abraham had two sons , the one by a bondmaid , the other by a freewoman .
But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh ; but he of the freewoman was by promise .
Which things are an allegory : for these are the two covenants ; the one from the mount Sinai , which gendereth to bondage , which is Agar .
For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia , and answereth to Jerusalem which now is , and is in bondage with her children .
But Jerusalem which is above is free , which is the mother of us all .
So then , brethren , we are not children of the bondwoman , but of the free .
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage .
Behold , I Paul say unto you , that if ye be circumcised , Christ shall profit you nothing .
Christ is become of no effect unto you , whosoever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith .
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision ; but faith which worketh by love .
Ye did run well ; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth ?
This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you .
I have confidence in you through the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded : but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment , whosoever he be .
And I , brethren , if I yet preach circumcision , why do I yet suffer persecution ? then is the offence of the cross ceased .
I would they were even cut off which trouble you .
For , brethren , ye have been called unto liberty ; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh , but by love serve one another .
For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh : and these are contrary the one to the other : so that ye cannot do the things that ye would .
But if ye be led of the Spirit , ye are not under the law .
Idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies ,
Envyings , murders , drunkenness , revellings , and such like : of the which I tell you before , as I have also told you in time past , that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God .
But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith ,
Meekness , temperance : against such there is no law .
And they that are Christ 's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts .
If we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit .
Let us not be desirous of vain glory , provoking one another , envying one another .
Brethren , if a man be overtaken in a fault , ye which are spiritual , restore such an one in the spirit of meekness ; considering thyself , lest thou also be tempted .
Bear ye one another 's burdens , and so fulfil the law of Christ .
For if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
But let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone , and not in another .
For every man shall bear his own burden .
Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things .
For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting .
As we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand .
As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised ; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ .
For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law ; but desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
And as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
From henceforth let no man trouble me : for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus .
Brethren , the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , to the saints which are at Ephesus , and to the faithful in Christ Jesus :
Grace be to you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ :
According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before him in love :
Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his will ,
To the praise of the glory of his grace , wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved .
In whom we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of sins , according to the riches of his grace ;
Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence ;
Having made known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself :
That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ , both which are in heaven , and which are on earth ; even in him :
In whom also we have obtained an inheritance , being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will :
That we should be to the praise of his glory , who first trusted in Christ .
In whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise ,
Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession , unto the praise of his glory .
That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him :
The eyes of your understanding being enlightened ; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling , and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe , according to the working of his mighty power ,
Which he wrought in Christ , when he raised him from the dead , and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places ,
Far above all principality , and power , and might , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come :
And hath put all things under his feet , and gave him to be the head over all things to the church ,
Which is his body , the fulness of him that filleth all in all .
And you hath he quickened , who were dead in trespasses and sins ;
Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience :
Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind ; and were by nature the children of wrath , even as others .
But God , who is rich in mercy , for his great love wherewith he loved us ,
Even when we were dead in sins , hath quickened us together with Christ , ( by grace ye are saved ; )
And hath raised us up together , and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus :
That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus .
For by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God :
Not of works , lest any man should boast .
For we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus unto good works , which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them .
That at that time ye were without Christ , being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no hope , and without God in the world :
But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ .
For he is our peace , who hath made both one , and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us ;
Having abolished in his flesh the enmity , even the law of commandments contained in ordinances ; for to make in himself of twain one new man , so making peace ;
And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross , having slain the enmity thereby :
And came and preached peace to you which were afar off , and to them that were nigh .
For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father .
Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners , but fellowcitizens with the saints , and of the household of God ;
And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone ;
In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord :
In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit .
For this cause I Paul , the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles ,
If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youward :
How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery ; ( as I wrote afore in few words ,
Whereby , when ye read , ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ )
Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men , as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit ;
Whereof I was made a minister , according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power .
Unto me , who am less than the least of all saints , is this grace given , that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ ;
And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery , which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God , who created all things by Jesus Christ :
To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God ,
According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord :
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him .
Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you , which is your glory .
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named ,
That he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man ;
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith ; that ye , being rooted and grounded in love ,
May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth , and length , and depth , and height ;
And to know the love of Christ , which passeth knowledge , that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God .
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that worketh in us ,
Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages , world without end . Amen .
I therefore , the prisoner of the Lord , beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called ,
With all lowliness and meekness , with longsuffering , forbearing one another in love ;
Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
There is one body , and one Spirit , even as ye are called in one hope of your calling ;
One Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
One God and Father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in you all .
But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens , that he might fill all things . )
And he gave some , apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , pastors and teachers ;
For the perfecting of the saints , for the work of the ministry , for the edifying of the body of Christ :
Till we all come in the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ :
That we henceforth be no more children , tossed to and fro , and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the sleight of men , and cunning craftiness , whereby they lie in wait to deceive ;
But speaking the truth in love , may grow up into him in all things , which is the head , even Christ :
From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
This I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
Having the understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart :
Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
But ye have not so learned Christ ;
If so be that ye have heard him , and have been taught by him , as the truth is in Jesus :
That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man , which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts ;
And be renewed in the spirit of your mind ;
And that ye put on the new man , which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness .
Wherefore putting away lying , speak every man truth with his neighbour : for we are members one of another .
Be ye angry , and sin not : let not the sun go down upon your wrath :
Neither give place to the devil .
Let him that stole steal no more : but rather let him labour , working with his hands the thing which is good , that he may have to give to him that needeth .
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth , but that which is good to the use of edifying , that it may minister grace unto the hearers .
And grieve not the holy Spirit of God , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption .
Let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamour , and evil speaking , be put away from you , with all malice :
And be ye kind one to another , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , even as God for Christ 's sake hath forgiven you .
Be ye therefore followers of God , as dear children ;
And walk in love , as Christ also hath loved us , and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour .
But fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not be once named among you , as becometh saints ;
Neither filthiness , nor foolish talking , nor jesting , which are not convenient : but rather giving of thanks .
For this ye know , that no whoremonger , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
Let no man deceive you with vain words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience .
Be not ye therefore partakers with them .
For ye were sometimes darkness , but now are ye light in the Lord : walk as children of light :
( For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ; )
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord .
And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them .
For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret .
But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light : for whatsoever doth make manifest is light .
See then that ye walk circumspectly , not as fools , but as wise ,
Redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
Wherefore be ye not unwise , but understanding what the will of the Lord is .
And be not drunk with wine , wherein is excess ; but be filled with the Spirit ;
Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God .
Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as unto the Lord .
For the husband is the head of the wife , even as Christ is the head of the church : and he is the saviour of the body .
Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ , so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing .
Husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself for it ;
That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word ,
That he might present it to himself a glorious church , not having spot , or wrinkle , or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without blemish .
So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies . He that loveth his wife loveth himself .
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh ; but nourisheth and cherisheth it , even as the Lord the church :
For we are members of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones .
This is a great mystery : but I speak concerning Christ and the church .
Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
Children , obey your parents in the Lord : for this is right .
And , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord .
With good will doing service , as to the Lord , and not to men :
Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth , the same shall he receive of the Lord , whether he be bond or free .
Finally , my brethren , be strong in the Lord , and in the power of his might .
Put on the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places .
Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand .
And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace ;
Above all , taking the shield of faith , wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked .
And take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God :
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit , and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints ;
And for me , that utterance may be given unto me , that I may open my mouth boldly , to make known the mystery of the gospel ,
For which I am an ambassador in bonds : that therein I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
But that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , Tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things :
Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
Peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity . Amen .
Paul and Timotheus , the servants of Jesus Christ , to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi , with the bishops and deacons :
Grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you ,
Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy ,
For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now ;
Being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ :
Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart ; inasmuch as both in my bonds , and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel , ye all are partakers of my grace .
For God is my record , how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ .
That ye may approve things that are excellent ; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ ;
Being filled with the fruits of righteousness , which are by Jesus Christ , unto the glory and praise of God .
But I would ye should understand , brethren , that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel ;
So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace , and in all other places ;
And many of the brethren in the Lord , waxing confident by my bonds , are much more bold to speak the word without fear .
Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife ; and some also of good will :
The one preach Christ of contention , not sincerely , supposing to add affliction to my bonds :
But the other of love , knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel .
What then ? notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretence , or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
According to my earnest expectation and my hope , that in nothing I shall be ashamed , but that with all boldness , as always , so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether it be by life , or by death .
For to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
But if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wot not .
For I am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and to be with Christ ; which is far better :
Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you .
And having this confidence , I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith ;
That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again .
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ : that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
And in nothing terrified by your adversaries : which is to them an evident token of perdition , but to you of salvation , and that of God .
For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ , not only to believe on him , but also to suffer for his sake ;
Having the same conflict which ye saw in me , and now hear to be in me .
If there be therefore any consolation in Christ , if any comfort of love , if any fellowship of the Spirit , if any bowels and mercies ,
Fulfil ye my joy , that ye be likeminded , having the same love , being of one accord , of one mind .
Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory ; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves .
Look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
Let this mind be in you , which was also in Christ Jesus :
Who , being in the form of God , thought it not robbery to be equal with God :
But made himself of no reputation , and took upon him the form of a servant , and was made in the likeness of men :
And being found in fashion as a man , he humbled himself , and became obedient unto death , even the death of the cross .
Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name :
That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven , and things in earth , and things under the earth ;
Wherefore , my beloved , as ye have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure .
Do all things without murmurings and disputings :
That ye may be blameless and harmless , the sons of God , without rebuke , in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world ;
Holding forth the word of life ; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ , that I have not run in vain , neither laboured in vain .
For the same cause also do ye joy , and rejoice with me .
But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know your state .
For I have no man likeminded , who will naturally care for your state .
For all seek their own , not the things which are Jesus Christ 's .
But ye know the proof of him , that , as a son with the father , he hath served with me in the gospel .
Him therefore I hope to send presently , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly .
Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , and companion in labour , and fellowsoldier , but your messenger , and he that ministered to my wants .
For he longed after you all , and was full of heaviness , because that ye had heard that he had been sick .
For indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness ; and hold such in reputation :
Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death , not regarding his life , to supply your lack of service toward me .
Finally , my brethren , rejoice in the Lord . To write the same things to you , to me indeed is not grievous , but for you it is safe .
Beware of dogs , beware of evil workers , beware of the concision .
For we are the circumcision , which worship God in the spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh .
Though I might also have confidence in the flesh . If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh , I more :
Circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , an Hebrew of the Hebrews ; as touching the law , a Pharisee ;
Concerning zeal , persecuting the church ; touching the righteousness which is in the law , blameless .
But what things were gain to me , those I counted loss for Christ .
Yea doubtless , and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord : for whom I have suffered the loss of all things , and do count them but dung , that I may win Christ ,
And be found in him , not having mine own righteousness , which is of the law , but that which is through the faith of Christ , the righteousness which is of God by faith :
That I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made conformable unto his death ;
If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead .
Not as though I had already attained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus .
I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus .
Let us therefore , as many as be perfect , be thus minded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded , God shall reveal even this unto you .
Nevertheless , whereto we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
Brethren , be followers together of me , and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample .
( For many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ :
Whose end is destruction , whose God is their belly , and whose glory is in their shame , who mind earthly things . )
For our conversation is in heaven ; from whence also we look for the Saviour , the Lord Jesus Christ :
Who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
Therefore , my brethren dearly beloved and longed for , my joy and crown , so stand fast in the Lord , my dearly beloved .
I beseech Euodias , and beseech Syntyche , that they be of the same mind in the Lord .
And I intreat thee also , true yokefellow , help those women which laboured with me in the gospel , with Clement also , and with other my fellowlabourers , whose names are in the book of life .
Let your moderation be known unto all men . The Lord is at hand .
Be careful for nothing ; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God .
And the peace of God , which passeth all understanding , shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus .
Finally , brethren , whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report ; if there be any virtue , and if there be any praise , think on these things .
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly , that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again ; wherein ye were also careful , but ye lacked opportunity .
Not that I speak in respect of want : for I have learned , in whatsoever state I am , therewith to be content .
I know both how to be abased , and I know how to abound : every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me .
Notwithstanding ye have well done , that ye did communicate with my affliction .
Now ye Philippians know also , that in the beginning of the gospel , when I departed from Macedonia , no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving , but ye only .
For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity .
Not because I desire a gift : but I desire fruit that may abound to your account .
But I have all , and abound : I am full , having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you , an odour of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , wellpleasing to God .
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus .
Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
Salute every saint in Christ Jesus . The brethren which are with me greet you .
All the saints salute you , chiefly they that are of Caesar 's household .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timotheus our brother ,
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse : Grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which ye have to all the saints ,
For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven , whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel ;
Which is come unto you , as it is in all the world ; and bringeth forth fruit , as it doth also in you , since the day ye heard of it , and knew the grace of God in truth :
As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant , who is for you a faithful minister of Christ ;
Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit .
Strengthened with all might , according to his glorious power , unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness ;
Giving thanks unto the Father , which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light :
Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness , and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son :
In whom we have redemption through his blood , even the forgiveness of sins :
Who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of every creature :
For by him were all things created , that are in heaven , and that are in earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thrones , or dominions , or principalities , or powers : all things were created by him , and for him :
And he is before all things , and by him all things consist .
And , having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconcile all things unto himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in earth , or things in heaven .
And you , that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works , yet now hath he reconciled
In the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight :
If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled , and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel , which ye have heard , and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven ; whereof I Paul am made a minister ;
Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you , and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body 's sake , which is the church :
Whereof I am made a minister , according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you , to fulfil the word of God ;
Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations , but now is made manifest to his saints :
To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles ; which is Christ in you , the hope of glory :
Whom we preach , warning every man , and teaching every man in all wisdom ; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus :
Whereunto I also labour , striving according to his working , which worketh in me mightily .
For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you , and for them at Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh ;
That their hearts might be comforted , being knit together in love , and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding , to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God , and of the Father , and of Christ ;
In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
And this I say , lest any man should beguile you with enticing words .
For though I be absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , joying and beholding your order , and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ .
As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord , so walk ye in him :
Rooted and built up in him , and stablished in the faith , as ye have been taught , abounding therein with thanksgiving .
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the rudiments of the world , and not after Christ .
For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily .
And ye are complete in him , which is the head of all principality and power :
In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands , in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ :
Buried with him in baptism , wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hath raised him from the dead .
And you , being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh , hath he quickened together with him , having forgiven you all trespasses ;
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , nailing it to his cross ;
And having spoiled principalities and powers , he made a shew of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
Let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an holyday , or of the new moon , or of the sabbath days :
Which are a shadow of things to come ; but the body is of Christ .
And not holding the Head , from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered , and knit together , increaseth with the increase of God .
Which all are to perish with the using ; ) after the commandments and doctrines of men ?
Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship , and humility , and neglecting of the body ; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh .
If ye then be risen with Christ , seek those things which are above , where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God .
Set your affection on things above , not on things on the earth .
For ye are dead , and your life is hid with Christ in God .
When Christ , who is our life , shall appear , then shall ye also appear with him in glory .
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth ; fornication , uncleanness , inordinate affection , evil concupiscence , and covetousness , which is idolatry :
For which things ' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience :
In the which ye also walked some time , when ye lived in them .
Lie not one to another , seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds ;
And have put on the new man , which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him :
Where there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , Barbarian , Scythian , bond nor free : but Christ is all , and in all .
Forbearing one another , and forgiving one another , if any man have a quarrel against any : even as Christ forgave you , so also do ye .
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to the which also ye are called in one body ; and be ye thankful .
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom ; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord .
And whatsoever ye do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God and the Father by him .
Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as it is fit in the Lord .
Husbands , love your wives , and be not bitter against them .
Children , obey your parents in all things : for this is well pleasing unto the Lord .
Fathers , provoke not your children to anger , lest they be discouraged .
Servants , obey in all things your masters according to the flesh ; not with eyeservice , as menpleasers ; but in singleness of heart , fearing God :
And whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord , and not unto men ;
Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance : for ye serve the Lord Christ .
But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done : and there is no respect of persons .
Masters , give unto your servants that which is just and equal ; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven .
Continue in prayer , and watch in the same with thanksgiving ;
Withal praying also for us , that God would open unto us a door of utterance , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds :
That I may make it manifest , as I ought to speak .
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without , redeeming the time .
Let your speech be alway with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man .
All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you , who is a beloved brother , and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord :
Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that he might know your estate , and comfort your hearts ;
Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you , and Marcus , sister 's son to Barnabas , ( touching whom ye received commandments : if he come unto you , receive him ; )
And Jesus , which is called Justus , who are of the circumcision . These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God , which have been a comfort unto me .
Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ , saluteth you , always labouring fervently for you in prayers , that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God .
For I bear him record , that he hath a great zeal for you , and them that are in Laodicea , and them in Hierapolis .
Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas , greet you .
Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the church which is in his house .
And when this epistle is read among you , cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans ; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea .
The salutation by the hand of me Paul . Remember my bonds . Grace be with you . Amen .
Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
We give thanks to God always for you all , making mention of you in our prayers ;
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith , and labour of love , and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , in the sight of God and our Father ;
Knowing , brethren beloved , your election of God .
For our gospel came not unto you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Ghost , and in much assurance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
And ye became followers of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Ghost :
So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia .
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you , and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God ;
And to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , even Jesus , which delivered us from the wrath to come .
For yourselves , brethren , know our entrance in unto you , that it was not in vain :
But even after that we had suffered before , and were shamefully entreated , as ye know , at Philippi , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention .
For our exhortation was not of deceit , nor of uncleanness , nor in guile :
But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel , even so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , which trieth our hearts .
For neither at any time used we flattering words , as ye know , nor a cloke of covetousness ; God is witness :
Nor of men sought we glory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been burdensome , as the apostles of Christ .
But we were gentle among you , even as a nurse cherisheth her children :
For ye remember , brethren , our labour and travail : for labouring night and day , because we would not be chargeable unto any of you , we preached unto you the gospel of God .
Ye are witnesses , and God also , how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe :
As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you , as a father doth his children ,
That ye would walk worthy of God , who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory .
For this cause also thank we God without ceasing , because , when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us , ye received it not as the word of men , but as it is in truth , the word of God , which effectually worketh also in you that believe .
For ye , brethren , became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus : for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen , even as they have of the Jews :
Who both killed the Lord Jesus , and their own prophets , and have persecuted us ; and they please not God , and are contrary to all men :
Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved , to fill up their sins alway : for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost .
But we , brethren , being taken from you for a short time in presence , not in heart , endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire .
Wherefore we would have come unto you , even I Paul , once and again ; but Satan hindered us .
For what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming ?
For ye are our glory and joy .
That no man should be moved by these afflictions : for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto .
For verily , when we were with you , we told you before that we should suffer tribulation ; even as it came to pass , and ye know .
For this cause , when I could no longer forbear , I sent to know your faith , lest by some means the tempter have tempted you , and our labour be in vain .
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us , and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity , and that ye have good remembrance of us always , desiring greatly to see us , as we also to see you :
Therefore , brethren , we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith :
For now we live , if ye stand fast in the Lord .
For what thanks can we render to God again for you , for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God ;
Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face , and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
Now God himself and our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way unto you .
And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you :
To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God , even our Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints .
Furthermore then we beseech you , brethren , and exhort you by the Lord Jesus , that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God , so ye would abound more and more .
For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus .
For this is the will of God , even your sanctification , that ye should abstain from fornication :
That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour ;
Not in the lust of concupiscence , even as the Gentiles which know not God :
That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter : because that the Lord is the avenger of all such , as we also have forewarned you and testified .
For God hath not called us unto uncleanness , but unto holiness .
He therefore that despiseth , despiseth not man , but God , who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit .
But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another .
And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia : but we beseech you , brethren , that ye increase more and more ;
And that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we commanded you ;
That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without , and that ye may have lack of nothing .
But I would not have you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning them which are asleep , that ye sorrow not , even as others which have no hope .
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him .
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord , that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep .
For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first :
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the Lord .
Wherefore comfort one another with these words .
But of the times and the seasons , brethren , ye have no need that I write unto you .
For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night .
But ye , brethren , are not in darkness , that that day should overtake you as a thief .
Ye are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkness .
Therefore let us not sleep , as do others ; but let us watch and be sober .
For they that sleep sleep in the night ; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night .
But let us , who are of the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love ; and for an helmet , the hope of salvation .
Who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with him .
Wherefore comfort yourselves together , and edify one another , even as also ye do .
And we beseech you , brethren , to know them which labour among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ;
And to esteem them very highly in love for their work 's sake . And be at peace among yourselves .
Now we exhort you , brethren , warn them that are unruly , comfort the feebleminded , support the weak , be patient toward all men .
See that none render evil for evil unto any man ; but ever follow that which is good , both among yourselves , and to all men .
Rejoice evermore .
Pray without ceasing .
In every thing give thanks : for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you .
Quench not the Spirit .
Despise not prophesyings .
Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good .
Abstain from all appearance of evil .
Faithful is he that calleth you , who also will do it .
Brethren , pray for us .
Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss .
I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
Grace unto you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
We are bound to thank God always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because that your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth ;
So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure :
Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God , that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which ye also suffer :
Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you ;
And to you who are troubled rest with us , when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels ,
In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ :
Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power ;
When he shall come to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired in all them that believe ( because our testimony among you was believed ) in that day .
Wherefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power :
That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you , and ye in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Now we beseech you , brethren , by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , and by our gathering together unto him ,
That ye be not soon shaken in mind , or be troubled , neither by spirit , nor by word , nor by letter as from us , as that the day of Christ is at hand .
Let no man deceive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of perdition ;
Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God , or that is worshipped ; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God , shewing himself that he is God .
Remember ye not , that , when I was yet with you , I told you these things ?
And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time .
For the mystery of iniquity doth already work : only he who now letteth will let , until he be taken out of the way .
And then shall that Wicked be revealed , whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth , and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming :
Even him , whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders ,
And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish ; because they received not the love of the truth , that they might be saved .
And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion , that they should believe a lie :
That they all might be damned who believed not the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you , brethren beloved of the Lord , because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth :
Whereunto he called you by our gospel , to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
Therefore , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye have been taught , whether by word , or our epistle .
Finally , brethren , pray for us , that the word of the Lord may have free course , and be glorified , even as it is with you :
And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men : for all men have not faith .
But the Lord is faithful , who shall stablish you , and keep you from evil .
And we have confidence in the Lord touching you , that ye both do and will do the things which we command you .
And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patient waiting for Christ .
Now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us : for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you ;
Neither did we eat any man 's bread for nought ; but wrought with labour and travail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you :
For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly , working not at all , but are busybodies .
Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
But ye , brethren , be not weary in well doing .
And if any man obey not our word by this epistle , note that man , and have no company with him , that he may be ashamed .
Yet count him not as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means . The Lord be with you all .
The salutation of Paul with mine own hand , which is the token in every epistle : so I write .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour , and Lord Jesus Christ , which is our hope ;
Unto Timothy , my own son in the faith : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord .
As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus , when I went into Macedonia , that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine ,
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which minister questions , rather than godly edifying which is in faith : so do .
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart , and of a good conscience , and of faith unfeigned :
From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling ;
Desiring to be teachers of the law ; understanding neither what they say , nor whereof they affirm .
But we know that the law is good , if a man use it lawfully ;
Knowing this , that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and for sinners , for unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
For whoremongers , for them that defile themselves with mankind , for menstealers , for liars , for perjured persons , and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine ;
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust .
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who hath enabled me , for that he counted me faithful , putting me into the ministry ;
Who was before a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and injurious : but I obtained mercy , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief .
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering , for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting .
Now unto the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only wise God , be honour and glory for ever and ever . Amen .
This charge I commit unto thee , son Timothy , according to the prophecies which went before on thee , that thou by them mightest war a good warfare ;
Holding faith , and a good conscience ; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck :
Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I have delivered unto Satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme .
I exhort therefore , that , first of all , supplications , prayers , intercessions , and giving of thanks , be made for all men ;
For kings , and for all that are in authority ; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty .
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour ;
Who will have all men to be saved , and to come unto the knowledge of the truth .
For there is one God , and one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus ;
Who gave himself a ransom for all , to be testified in due time .
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher , and an apostle , ( I speak the truth in Christ , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity .
I will therefore that men pray every where , lifting up holy hands , without wrath and doubting .
In like manner also , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with shamefacedness and sobriety ; not with broided hair , or gold , or pearls , or costly array ;
But ( which becometh women professing godliness ) with good works .
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection .
But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
For Adam was first formed , then Eve .
And Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived was in the transgression .
Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing , if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety .
A bishop then must be blameless , the husband of one wife , vigilant , sober , of good behaviour , given to hospitality , apt to teach ;
Not given to wine , no striker , not greedy of filthy lucre ; but patient , not a brawler , not covetous ;
One that ruleth well his own house , having his children in subjection with all gravity ;
( For if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
Not a novice , lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil .
Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
Likewise must the deacons be grave , not doubletongued , not given to much wine , not greedy of filthy lucre ;
Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
And let these also first be proved ; then let them use the office of a deacon , being found blameless .
Even so must their wives be grave , not slanderers , sober , faithful in all things .
Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree , and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
These things write I unto thee , hoping to come unto thee shortly :
But if I tarry long , that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly , that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits , and doctrines of devils ;
Speaking lies in hypocrisy ; having their conscience seared with a hot iron ;
Forbidding to marry , and commanding to abstain from meats , which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth .
For every creature of God is good , and nothing to be refused , if it be received with thanksgiving :
For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer .
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ , nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine , whereunto thou hast attained .
But refuse profane and old wives ' fables , and exercise thyself rather unto godliness .
For bodily exercise profiteth little : but godliness is profitable unto all things , having promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to come .
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation .
For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach , because we trust in the living God , who is the Saviour of all men , specially of those that believe .
These things command and teach .
Let no man despise thy youth ; but be thou an example of the believers , in word , in conversation , in charity , in spirit , in faith , in purity .
Till I come , give attendance to reading , to exhortation , to doctrine .
Neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery .
Meditate upon these things ; give thyself wholly to them ; that thy profiting may appear to all .
Take heed unto thyself , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself , and them that hear thee .
Rebuke not an elder , but intreat him as a father ; and the younger men as brethren ;
The elder women as mothers ; the younger as sisters , with all purity .
Honour widows that are widows indeed .
Now she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , trusteth in God , and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day .
But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth .
And these things give in charge , that they may be blameless .
But if any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel .
Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old , having been the wife of one man ,
Well reported of for good works ; if she have brought up children , if she have lodged strangers , if she have washed the saints ' feet , if she have relieved the afflicted , if she have diligently followed every good work .
But the younger widows refuse : for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ , they will marry ;
Having damnation , because they have cast off their first faith .
And withal they learn to be idle , wandering about from house to house ; and not only idle , but tattlers also and busybodies , speaking things which they ought not .
I will therefore that the younger women marry , bear children , guide the house , give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully .
For some are already turned aside after Satan .
If any man or woman that believeth have widows , let them relieve them , and let not the church be charged ; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed .
Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour , especially they who labour in the word and doctrine .
Against an elder receive not an accusation , but before two or three witnesses .
Them that sin rebuke before all , that others also may fear .
I charge thee before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
Lay hands suddenly on no man , neither be partaker of other men 's sins : keep thyself pure .
Drink no longer water , but use a little wine for thy stomach 's sake and thine often infirmities .
Some men 's sins are open beforehand , going before to judgment ; and some men they follow after .
Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand ; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid .
Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed .
And they that have believing masters , let them not despise them , because they are brethren ; but rather do them service , because they are faithful and beloved , partakers of the benefit . These things teach and exhort .
If any man teach otherwise , and consent not to wholesome words , even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to the doctrine which is according to godliness ;
He is proud , knowing nothing , but doting about questions and strifes of words , whereof cometh envy , strife , railings , evil surmisings ,
Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds , and destitute of the truth , supposing that gain is godliness : from such withdraw thyself .
But godliness with contentment is great gain .
For we brought nothing into this world , and it is certain we can carry nothing out .
And having food and raiment let us be therewith content .
For the love of money is the root of all evil : which while some coveted after , they have erred from the faith , and pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
But thou , O man of God , flee these things ; and follow after righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience , meekness .
Fight the good fight of faith , lay hold on eternal life , whereunto thou art also called , and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses .
That thou keep this commandment without spot , unrebukeable , until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ :
Which in his times he shall shew , who is the blessed and only Potentate , the King of kings , and Lord of lords ;
Who only hath immortality , dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto ; whom no man hath seen , nor can see : to whom be honour and power everlasting . Amen .
Charge them that are rich in this world , that they be not highminded , nor trust in uncertain riches , but in the living God , who giveth us richly all things to enjoy ;
That they do good , that they be rich in good works , ready to distribute , willing to communicate ;
Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold on eternal life .
Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus ,
To Timothy , my dearly beloved son : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
I thank God , whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience , that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day ;
Greatly desiring to see thee , being mindful of thy tears , that I may be filled with joy ;
When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and thy mother Eunice ; and I am persuaded that in thee also .
Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God , which is in thee by the putting on of my hands .
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power , and of love , and of a sound mind .
Who hath saved us , and called us with an holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began ,
But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ , who hath abolished death , and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel :
Whereunto I am appointed a preacher , and an apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles .
Hold fast the form of sound words , which thou hast heard of me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
This thou knowest , that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me ; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes .
The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus ; for he oft refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain :
But , when he was in Rome , he sought me out very diligently , and found me .
The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day : and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus , thou knowest very well .
Thou therefore , my son , be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus .
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
Thou therefore endure hardness , as a good soldier of Jesus Christ .
No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life ; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier .
And if a man also strive for masteries , yet is he not crowned , except he strive lawfully .
The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits .
Consider what I say ; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things .
Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel :
Therefore I endure all things for the elect 's sakes , that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
If we suffer , we shall also reign with him : if we deny him , he also will deny us :
If we believe not , yet he abideth faithful : he cannot deny himself .
Of these things put them in remembrance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit , but to the subverting of the hearers .
Study to shew thyself approved unto God , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth .
But shun profane and vain babblings : for they will increase unto more ungodliness .
And their word will eat as doth a canker : of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus ;
Who concerning the truth have erred , saying that the resurrection is past already ; and overthrow the faith of some .
But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of earth ; and some to honour , and some to dishonour .
If a man therefore purge himself from these , he shall be a vessel unto honour , sanctified , and meet for the master 's use , and prepared unto every good work .
Flee also youthful lusts : but follow righteousness , faith , charity , peace , with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
But foolish and unlearned questions avoid , knowing that they do gender strifes .
And the servant of the Lord must not strive ; but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient ,
In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves ; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ;
And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , who are taken captive by him at his will .
This know also , that in the last days perilous times shall come .
For men shall be lovers of their own selves , covetous , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy ,
Without natural affection , trucebreakers , false accusers , incontinent , fierce , despisers of those that are good ,
Traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ;
Having a form of godliness , but denying the power thereof : from such turn away .
For of this sort are they which creep into houses , and lead captive silly women laden with sins , led away with divers lusts ,
Ever learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses , so do these also resist the truth : men of corrupt minds , reprobate concerning the faith .
But they shall proceed no further : for their folly shall be manifest unto all men , as theirs also was .
But thou hast fully known my doctrine , manner of life , purpose , faith , longsuffering , charity , patience ,
Persecutions , afflictions , which came unto me at Antioch , at Iconium , at Lystra ; what persecutions I endured : but out of them all the Lord delivered me .
Yea , and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution .
But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse , deceiving , and being deceived .
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of , knowing of whom thou hast learned them ;
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures , which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus .
All scripture is given by inspiration of God , and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness :
That the man of God may be perfect , throughly furnished unto all good works .
Preach the word ; be instant in season , out of season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine .
For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine ; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers , having itching ears ;
And they shall turn away their ears from the truth , and shall be turned unto fables .
But watch thou in all things , endure afflictions , do the work of an evangelist , make full proof of thy ministry .
For I am now ready to be offered , and the time of my departure is at hand .
I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith :
Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , shall give me at that day : and not to me only , but unto all them also that love his appearing .
For Demas hath forsaken me , having loved this present world , and is departed unto Thessalonica ; Crescens to Galatia , Titus unto Dalmatia .
Only Luke is with me . Take Mark , and bring him with thee : for he is profitable to me for the ministry .
And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus .
The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus , when thou comest , bring with thee , and the books , but especially the parchments .
Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil : the Lord reward him according to his works :
Of whom be thou ware also ; for he hath greatly withstood our words .
At my first answer no man stood with me , but all men forsook me : I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge .
Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me , and strengthened me ; that by me the preaching might be fully known , and that all the Gentiles might hear : and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .
And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom : to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
Salute Prisca and Aquila , and the household of Onesiphorus .
Erastus abode at Corinth : but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick .
Do thy diligence to come before winter . Eubulus greeteth thee , and Pudens , and Linus , and Claudia , and all the brethren .
The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit . Grace be with you . Amen .
Paul , a servant of God , and an apostle of Jesus Christ , according to the faith of God 's elect , and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness ;
In hope of eternal life , which God , that cannot lie , promised before the world began ;
But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching , which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour ;
To Titus , mine own son after the common faith : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour .
For this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee :
If any be blameless , the husband of one wife , having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly .
For a bishop must be blameless , as the steward of God ; not selfwilled , not soon angry , not given to wine , no striker , not given to filthy lucre ;
But a lover of hospitality , a lover of good men , sober , just , holy , temperate ;
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught , that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers .
For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers , specially they of the circumcision :
Whose mouths must be stopped , who subvert whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for filthy lucre 's sake .
This witness is true . Wherefore rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ;
Not giving heed to Jewish fables , and commandments of men , that turn from the truth .
Unto the pure all things are pure : but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure ; but even their mind and conscience is defiled .
They profess that they know God ; but in works they deny him , being abominable , and disobedient , and unto every good work reprobate .
But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine :
That the aged men be sober , grave , temperate , sound in faith , in charity , in patience .
The aged women likewise , that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness , not false accusers , not given to much wine , teachers of good things ;
That they may teach the young women to be sober , to love their husbands , to love their children ,
To be discreet , chaste , keepers at home , good , obedient to their own husbands , that the word of God be not blasphemed .
Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded .
In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works : in doctrine shewing uncorruptness , gravity , sincerity ,
Sound speech , that cannot be condemned ; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed , having no evil thing to say of you .
For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men ,
Teaching us that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we should live soberly , righteously , and godly , in this present world ;
Looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ ;
Who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify unto himself a peculiar people , zealous of good works .
These things speak , and exhort , and rebuke with all authority . Let no man despise thee .
For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish , disobedient , deceived , serving divers lusts and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful , and hating one another .
But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared ,
Not by works of righteousness which we have done , but according to his mercy he saved us , by the washing of regeneration , and renewing of the Holy Ghost ;
Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour ;
That being justified by his grace , we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
This is a faithful saying , and these things I will that thou affirm constantly , that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works . These things are good and profitable unto men .
A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject ;
Knowing that he that is such is subverted , and sinneth , being condemned of himself .
When I shall send Artemas unto thee , or Tychicus , be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis : for I have determined there to winter .
Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently , that nothing be wanting unto them .
And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses , that they be not unfruitful .
All that are with me salute thee . Greet them that love us in the faith . Grace be with you all . Amen .
Paul , a prisoner of Jesus Christ , and Timothy our brother , unto Philemon our dearly beloved , and fellowlabourer ,
And to our beloved Apphia , and Archippus our fellowsoldier , and to the church in thy house :
Grace to you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
I thank my God , making mention of thee always in my prayers ,
Hearing of thy love and faith , which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus , and toward all saints ;
That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus .
For we have great joy and consolation in thy love , because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee , brother .
Wherefore , though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient ,
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my bonds :
Which in time past was to thee unprofitable , but now profitable to thee and to me :
Whom I have sent again : thou therefore receive him , that is , mine own bowels :
Whom I would have retained with me , that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel :
But without thy mind would I do nothing ; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity , but willingly .
For perhaps he therefore departed for a season , that thou shouldest receive him for ever ;
Not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved , specially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh , and in the Lord ?
If thou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
If he hath wronged thee , or oweth thee ought , put that on mine account ;
I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides .
Yea , brother , let me have joy of thee in the Lord : refresh my bowels in the Lord .
Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee , knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say .
But withal prepare me also a lodging : for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you .
There salute thee Epaphras , my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus ;
Marcus , Aristarchus , Demas , Lucas , my fellowlabourers .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
God , who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets ,
Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ;
Who being the brightness of his glory , and the express image of his person , and upholding all things by the word of his power , when he had by himself purged our sins , sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high ;
Being made so much better than the angels , as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they .
They shall perish ; but thou remainest ; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment ;
Are they not all ministering spirits , sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation ?
Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard , lest at any time we should let them slip .
For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast , and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward ;
How shall we escape , if we neglect so great salvation ; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord , and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him ;
God also bearing them witness , both with signs and wonders , and with divers miracles , and gifts of the Holy Ghost , according to his own will ?
For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come , whereof we speak .
Thou madest him a little lower than the angels ; thou crownedst him with glory and honour , and didst set him over the works of thy hands :
For it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one : for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
For verily he took not on him the nature of angels ; but he took on him the seed of Abraham .
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren , that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make reconciliation for the sins of the people .
For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted , he is able to succour them that are tempted .
Wherefore , holy brethren , partakers of the heavenly calling , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession , Christ Jesus ;
Who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also Moses was faithful in all his house .
For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses , inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house .
For every house is builded by some man ; but he that built all things is God .
And Moses verily was faithful in all his house , as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after ;
But Christ as a son over his own house ; whose house are we , if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end .
Harden not your hearts , as in the provocation , in the day of temptation in the wilderness :
When your fathers tempted me , proved me , and saw my works forty years .
Take heed , brethren , lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief , in departing from the living God .
For we are made partakers of Christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end ;
For some , when they had heard , did provoke : howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
But with whom was he grieved forty years ? was it not with them that had sinned , whose carcases fell in the wilderness ?
And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that believed not ?
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief .
Let us therefore fear , lest , a promise being left us of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to come short of it .
For unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein , and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief :
For if Jesus had given them rest , then would he not afterward have spoken of another day .
There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God .
For he that is entered into his rest , he also hath ceased from his own works , as God did from his .
Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest , lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief .
For the word of God is quick , and powerful , and sharper than any twoedged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
Seeing then that we have a great high priest , that is passed into the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our profession .
For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ; but was in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sin .
Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy , and find grace to help in time of need .
For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins :
Who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity .
And by reason hereof he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
And no man taketh this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron .
Who in the days of his flesh , when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death , and was heard in that he feared ;
And being made perfect , he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him ;
Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec .
Of whom we have many things to say , and hard to be uttered , seeing ye are dull of hearing .
For when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat .
For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe .
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil .
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God ,
Of the doctrine of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
And this will we do , if God permit .
For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from God :
But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected , and is nigh unto cursing ; whose end is to be burned .
But , beloved , we are persuaded better things of you , and things that accompany salvation , though we thus speak .
For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister .
And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end :
That ye be not slothful , but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
For when God made promise to Abraham , because he could swear by no greater , he sware by himself ,
And so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
For men verily swear by the greater : and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife .
Wherein God , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath :
That by two immutable things , in which it was impossible for God to lie , we might have a strong consolation , who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us :
Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and stedfast , and which entereth into that within the veil ;
Whither the forerunner is for us entered , even Jesus , made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
For this Melchisedec , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ;
Without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; abideth a priest continually .
Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils .
And verily they that are of the sons of Levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though they come out of the loins of Abraham :
But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham , and blessed him that had the promises .
And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better .
And here men that die receive tithes ; but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
And as I may so say , Levi also , who receiveth tithes , payed tithes in Abraham .
For he was yet in the loins of his father , when Melchisedec met him .
If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood , ( for under it the people received the law , ) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec , and not be called after the order of Aaron ?
For the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law .
For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar .
For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda ; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood .
And it is yet far more evident : for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest ,
Who is made , not after the law of a carnal commandment , but after the power of an endless life .
For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof .
For the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God .
And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest :
By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament .
And they truly were many priests , because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death :
But this man , because he continueth ever , hath an unchangeable priesthood .
Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
For such an high priest became us , who is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
Who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people 's : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .
For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore .
Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum : We have such an high priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens ;
A minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , and not man .
For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer .
For if he were on earth , he should not be a priest , seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law :
But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises .
For if that first covenant had been faultless , then should no place have been sought for the second .
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; because they continued not in my covenant , and I regarded them not , saith the Lord .
And they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
In that he saith , A new covenant , he hath made the first old . Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away .
Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service , and a worldly sanctuary .
For there was a tabernacle made ; the first , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary .
And after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all ;
Which had the golden censer , and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein was the golden pot that had manna , and Aaron 's rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ;
And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat ; of which we cannot now speak particularly .
Now when these things were thus ordained , the priests went always into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the service of God .
But into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
The Holy Ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing :
Which stood only in meats and drinks , and divers washings , and carnal ordinances , imposed on them until the time of reformation .
But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ;
Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh :
How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator .
For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth .
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood .
For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle , and all the vessels of the ministry .
And almost all things are by the law purged with blood ; and without shedding of blood is no remission .
It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us :
Nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ;
For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
And as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment :
So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many ; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation .
For the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect .
For then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins .
But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year .
For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins .
In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure .
By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins :
But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ;
From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool .
For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified .
Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
Having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus ,
By a new and living way , which he hath consecrated for us , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
And having an high priest over the house of God ;
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering ; ( for he is faithful that promised ; )
And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works :
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins ,
But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation , which shall devour the adversaries .
He that despised Moses ' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses :
Of how much sorer punishment , suppose ye , shall he be thought worthy , who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath counted the blood of the covenant , wherewith he was sanctified , an unholy thing , and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace ?
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
But call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ;
Cast not away therefore your confidence , which hath great recompence of reward .
For ye have need of patience , that , after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise .
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen .
For by it the elders obtained a good report .
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , by which he obtained witness that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts : and by it he being dead yet speaketh .
By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because God had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased God .
But without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
By faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :
For he looked for a city which hath foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed , and was delivered of a child when she was past age , because she judged him faithful who had promised .
Therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
These all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country .
And truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
But now they desire a better country , that is , an heavenly : wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God : for he hath prepared for them a city .
Accounting that God was able to raise him up , even from the dead ; from whence also he received him in a figure .
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come .
By faith Jacob , when he was a dying , blessed both the sons of Joseph ; and worshipped , leaning upon the top of his staff .
By faith Joseph , when he died , made mention of the departing of the children of Israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .
By faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
By faith Moses , when he was come to years , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh 's daughter ;
Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ;
Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt : for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward .
Through faith he kept the passover , and the sprinkling of blood , lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them .
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land : which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned .
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down , after they were compassed about seven days .
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not , when she had received the spies with peace .
And what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
Who through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
Quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
Women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tortured , not accepting deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection :
And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
( Of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
And these all , having obtained a good report through faith , received not the promise :
God having provided some better thing for us , that they without us should not be made perfect .
Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses , let us lay aside every weight , and the sin which doth so easily beset us , and let us run with patience the race that is set before us ,
Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God .
For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds .
Ye have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin .
If ye endure chastening , God dealeth with you as with sons ; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not ?
But if ye be without chastisement , whereof all are partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons .
Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us , and we gave them reverence : shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits , and live ?
For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure ; but he for our profit , that we might be partakers of his holiness .
Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous : nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby .
Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down , and the feeble knees ;
And make straight paths for your feet , lest that which is lame be turned out of the way ; but let it rather be healed .
Follow peace with all men , and holiness , without which no man shall see the Lord :
Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and thereby many be defiled ;
Lest there be any fornicator , or profane person , as Esau , who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright .
For ye know how that afterward , when he would have inherited the blessing , he was rejected : for he found no place of repentance , though he sought it carefully with tears .
For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched , and that burned with fire , nor unto blackness , and darkness , and tempest ,
And the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more :
But ye are come unto mount Sion , and unto the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to an innumerable company of angels ,
To the general assembly and church of the firstborn , which are written in heaven , and to God the Judge of all , and to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling , that speaketh better things than that of Abel .
See that ye refuse not him that speaketh . For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth , much more shall not we escape , if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven :
Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved , let us have grace , whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear :
For our God is a consuming fire .
Let brotherly love continue .
Be not forgetful to entertain strangers : for thereby some have entertained angels unawares .
Remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken unto you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
Jesus Christ the same yesterday , and to day , and for ever .
Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines . For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with meats , which have not profited them that have been occupied therein .
We have an altar , whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle .
For the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin , are burned without the camp .
For here have we no continuing city , but we seek one to come .
By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name .
But to do good and to communicate forget not : for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
Obey them that have the rule over you , and submit yourselves : for they watch for your souls , as they that must give account , that they may do it with joy , and not with grief : for that is unprofitable for you .
Pray for us : for we trust we have a good conscience , in all things willing to live honestly .
But I beseech you the rather to do this , that I may be restored to you the sooner .
And I beseech you , brethren , suffer the word of exhortation : for I have written a letter unto you in few words .
Grace be with you all . Amen .
James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad , greeting .
My brethren , count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations ;
Knowing this , that the trying of your faith worketh patience .
But let patience have her perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing .
If any of you lack wisdom , let him ask of God , that giveth to all men liberally , and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
But let him ask in faith , nothing wavering . For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed .
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted :
But the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat , but it withereth the grass , and the flower thereof falleth , and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth : so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways .
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him .
But every man is tempted , when he is drawn away of his own lust , and enticed .
Then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin : and sin , when it is finished , bringeth forth death .
Do not err , my beloved brethren .
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth , that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures .
Wherefore , my beloved brethren , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath :
For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God .
Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness , and receive with meekness the engrafted word , which is able to save your souls .
For if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass :
For he beholdeth himself , and goeth his way , and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was .
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty , and continueth therein , he being not a forgetful hearer , but a doer of the work , this man shall be blessed in his deed .
If any man among you seem to be religious , and bridleth not his tongue , but deceiveth his own heart , this man 's religion is vain .
My brethren , have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Lord of glory , with respect of persons .
For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring , in goodly apparel , and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment ;
Are ye not then partial in yourselves , and are become judges of evil thoughts ?
Hearken , my beloved brethren , Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?
But ye have despised the poor . Do not rich men oppress you , and draw you before the judgment seats ?
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called ?
But if ye have respect to persons , ye commit sin , and are convinced of the law as transgressors .
For whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet offend in one point , he is guilty of all .
So speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
For he shall have judgment without mercy , that hath shewed no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment .
What doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say he hath faith , and have not works ? can faith save him ?
If a brother or sister be naked , and destitute of daily food ,
Even so faith , if it hath not works , is dead , being alone .
Thou believest that there is one God ; thou doest well : the devils also believe , and tremble .
But wilt thou know , O vain man , that faith without works is dead ?
Was not Abraham our father justified by works , when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar ?
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works , and by works was faith made perfect ?
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works , when she had received the messengers , and had sent them out another way ?
For as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also .
My brethren , be not many masters , knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation .
For in many things we offend all . If any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body .
Behold , we put bits in the horses ' mouths , that they may obey us ; and we turn about their whole body .
Behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whithersoever the governor listeth .
Even so the tongue is a little member , and boasteth great things . Behold , how great a matter a little fire kindleth !
And the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquity : so is the tongue among our members , that it defileth the whole body , and setteth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
For every kind of beasts , and of birds , and of serpents , and of things in the sea , is tamed , and hath been tamed of mankind :
But the tongue can no man tame ; it is an unruly evil , full of deadly poison .
Therewith bless we God , even the Father ; and therewith curse we men , which are made after the similitude of God .
Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things ought not so to be .
Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter ?
Can the fig tree , my brethren , bear olive berries ? either a vine , figs ? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh .
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you ? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom .
But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts , glory not , and lie not against the truth .
For where envying and strife is , there is confusion and every evil work .
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , and easy to be intreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy .
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace .
From whence come wars and fightings among you ? come they not hence , even of your lusts that war in your members ?
Ye lust , and have not : ye kill , and desire to have , and cannot obtain : ye fight and war , yet ye have not , because ye ask not .
Ye ask , and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye may consume it upon your lusts .
Ye adulterers and adulteresses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God ? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .
Submit yourselves therefore to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
Draw nigh to God , and he will draw nigh to you . Cleanse your hands , ye sinners ; and purify your hearts , ye double minded .
Be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and he shall lift you up .
Speak not evil one of another , brethren . He that speaketh evil of his brother , and judgeth his brother , speaketh evil of the law , and judgeth the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
There is one lawgiver , who is able to save and to destroy : who art thou that judgest another ?
Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow . For what is your life ? It is even a vapour , that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away .
But now ye rejoice in your boastings : all such rejoicing is evil .
Therefore to him that knoweth to do good , and doeth it not , to him it is sin .
Go to now , ye rich men , weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you .
Your riches are corrupted , and your garments are motheaten .
Your gold and silver is cankered ; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you , and shall eat your flesh as it were fire . Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days .
Behold , the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , crieth : and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth .
Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth , and been wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts , as in a day of slaughter .
Ye have condemned and killed the just ; and he doth not resist you .
Be ye also patient ; stablish your hearts : for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh .
Take , my brethren , the prophets , who have spoken in the name of the Lord , for an example of suffering affliction , and of patience .
Behold , we count them happy which endure . Ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very pitiful , and of tender mercy .
Is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord :
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sins , they shall be forgiven him .
Confess your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed . The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much .
Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
And he prayed again , and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
Brethren , if any of you do err from the truth , and one convert him ;
Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , through sanctification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : Grace unto you , and peace , be multiplied .
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
To an inheritance incorruptible , and undefiled , and that fadeth not away , reserved in heaven for you ,
Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
That the trial of your faith , being much more precious than of gold that perisheth , though it be tried with fire , might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ :
Whom having not seen , ye love ; in whom , though now ye see him not , yet believing , ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory :
Receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you :
Searching what , or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify , when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ , and the glory that should follow .
Unto whom it was revealed , that not unto themselves , but unto us they did minister the things , which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven ; which things the angels desire to look into .
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind , be sober , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
As obedient children , not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance :
But as he which hath called you is holy , so be ye holy in all manner of conversation ;
And if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man 's work , pass the time of your sojourning here in fear :
Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things , as silver and gold , from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers ;
But with the precious blood of Christ , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot :
Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you ,
Who by him do believe in God , that raised him up from the dead , and gave him glory ; that your faith and hope might be in God .
Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren , see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently :
Being born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , by the word of God , which liveth and abideth for ever .
As newborn babes , desire the sincere milk of the word , that ye may grow thereby :
If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious .
Ye also , as lively stones , are built up a spiritual house , an holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God by Jesus Christ .
But ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light :
Which in time past were not a people , but are now the people of God : which had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
Dearly beloved , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ;
Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles : that , whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glorify God in the day of visitation .
Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord 's sake : whether it be to the king , as supreme ;
Or unto governors , as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers , and for the praise of them that do well .
For so is the will of God , that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
As free , and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness , but as the servants of God .
Honour all men . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honour the king .
Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
Who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , he threatened not ; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously :
Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness : by whose stripes ye were healed .
For ye were as sheep going astray ; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls .
Likewise , ye wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ;
While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear .
Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair , and of wearing of gold , or of putting on of apparel ;
For after this manner in the old time the holy women also , who trusted in God , adorned themselves , being in subjection unto their own husbands :
Even as Sara obeyed Abraham , calling him lord : whose daughters ye are , as long as ye do well , and are not afraid with any amazement .
Likewise , ye husbands , dwell with them according to knowledge , giving honour unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life ; that your prayers be not hindered .
Finally , be ye all of one mind , having compassion one of another , love as brethren , be pitiful , be courteous :
Not rendering evil for evil , or railing for railing : but contrariwise blessing ; knowing that ye are thereunto called , that ye should inherit a blessing .
And who is he that will harm you , if ye be followers of that which is good ?
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
Having a good conscience ; that , whereas they speak evil of you , as of evildoers , they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ .
For it is better , if the will of God be so , that ye suffer for well doing , than for evil doing .
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the Spirit :
By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ;
Which sometime were disobedient , when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was a preparing , wherein few , that is , eight souls were saved by water .
The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us ( not the putting away of the filth of the flesh , but the answer of a good conscience toward God , ) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ :
Who is gone into heaven , and is on the right hand of God ; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him .
That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men , but to the will of God .
For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles , when we walked in lasciviousness , lusts , excess of wine , revellings , banquetings , and abominable idolatries :
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot , speaking evil of you :
Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead .
For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit .
But the end of all things is at hand : be ye therefore sober , and watch unto prayer .
And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves : for charity shall cover the multitude of sins .
Use hospitality one to another without grudging .
As every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
If any man speak , let him speak as the oracles of God ; if any man minister , let him do it as of the ability which God giveth : that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
Beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you , as though some strange thing happened unto you :
But rejoice , inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ 's sufferings ; that , when his glory shall be revealed , ye may be glad also with exceeding joy .
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
Yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God on this behalf .
For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God : and if it first begin at us , what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God ?
The elders which are among you I exhort , who am also an elder , and a witness of the sufferings of Christ , and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed :
Feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not by constraint , but willingly ; not for filthy lucre , but of a ready mind ;
Neither as being lords over God 's heritage , but being ensamples to the flock .
And when the chief Shepherd shall appear , ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away .
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time :
Casting all your care upon him ; for he careth for you .
Be sober , be vigilant ; because your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about , seeking whom he may devour :
But the God of all grace , who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after that ye have suffered a while , make you perfect , stablish , strengthen , settle you .
To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
By Silvanus , a faithful brother unto you , as I suppose , I have written briefly , exhorting , and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand .
The church that is at Babylon , elected together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth Marcus my son .
Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity . Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ :
Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God , and of Jesus our Lord ,
According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue :
Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises : that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
For if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
But he that lacketh these things is blind , and cannot see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
Wherefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
Yea , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ;
Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle , even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me .
Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance .
For we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
And this voice which came from heaven we heard , when we were with him in the holy mount .
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost .
But there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who privily shall bring in damnable heresies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
And many shall follow their pernicious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of .
And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you : whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not , and their damnation slumbereth not .
For if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ;
And spared not the old world , but saved Noah the eighth person , a preacher of righteousness , bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly ;
And delivered just Lot , vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked :
( For that righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds ; )
The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations , and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished :
But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness , and despise government . Presumptuous are they , selfwilled , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities .
Whereas angels , which are greater in power and might , bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord .
But these , as natural brute beasts , made to be taken and destroyed , speak evil of the things that they understand not ; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption ;
And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time . Spots they are and blemishes , sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you ;
Having eyes full of adultery , and that cannot cease from sin ; beguiling unstable souls : an heart they have exercised with covetous practices ; cursed children :
Which have forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
But was rebuked for his iniquity : the dumb ass speaking with man 's voice forbad the madness of the prophet .
These are wells without water , clouds that are carried with a tempest ; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever .
For when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in error .
While they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bondage .
For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them .
This second epistle , beloved , I now write unto you ; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance :
That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour :
Knowing this first , that there shall come in the last days scoffers , walking after their own lusts ,
For this they willingly are ignorant of , that by the word of God the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of the water and in the water :
Whereby the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished :
But the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
But , beloved , be not ignorant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night ; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat , the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up .
Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness ,
Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God , wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat ?
Nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness .
Wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and blameless .
And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you ;
As also in all his epistles , speaking in them of these things ; in which are some things hard to be understood , which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest , as they do also the other scriptures , unto their own destruction .
Ye therefore , beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own stedfastness .
But grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . To him be glory both now and for ever . Amen .
That which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life ;
( For the life was manifested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and shew unto you that eternal life , which was with the Father , and was manifested unto us ; )
That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you , that ye also may have fellowship with us : and truly our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son Jesus Christ .
And these things write we unto you , that your joy may be full .
This then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
If we say that we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not the truth :
But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin .
If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
If we say that we have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
My little children , these things write I unto you , that ye sin not . And if any man sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous :
And he is the propitiation for our sins : and not for ours only , but also for the sins of the whole world .
And hereby we do know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
But whoso keepeth his word , in him verily is the love of God perfected : hereby know we that we are in him .
He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk , even as he walked .
Brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
Again , a new commandment I write unto you , which thing is true in him and in you : because the darkness is past , and the true light now shineth .
He that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is none occasion of stumbling in him .
But he that hateth his brother is in darkness , and walketh in darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth , because that darkness hath blinded his eyes .
I write unto you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
I write unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I write unto you , young men , because ye have overcome the wicked one . I write unto you , little children , because ye have known the Father .
Love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . If any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever .
Little children , it is the last time : and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come , even now are there many antichrists ; whereby we know that it is the last time .
They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us .
But ye have an unction from the Holy One , and ye know all things .
I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ? He is antichrist , that denieth the Father and the Son .
And this is the promise that he hath promised us , even eternal life .
These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you .
But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you , and ye need not that any man teach you : but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things , and is truth , and is no lie , and even as it hath taught you , ye shall abide in him .
And now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
If ye know that he is righteous , ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him .
Behold , what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of God : therefore the world knoweth us not , because it knew him not .
Beloved , now are we the sons of God , and it doth not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is .
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself , even as he is pure .
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law : for sin is the transgression of the law .
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins ; and in him is no sin .
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not : whosoever sinneth hath not seen him , neither known him .
Little children , let no man deceive you : he that doeth righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous .
He that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . For this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin ; for his seed remaineth in him : and he cannot sin , because he is born of God .
In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . And wherefore slew he him ? Because his own works were evil , and his brother 's righteous .
Marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you .
We know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . He that loveth not his brother abideth in death .
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
Hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
But whoso hath this world 's good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
My little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth .
And whatsoever we ask , we receive of him , because we keep his commandments , and do those things that are pleasing in his sight .
And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him , and he in him . And hereby we know that he abideth in us , by the Spirit which he hath given us .
Beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of God : because many false prophets are gone out into the world .
And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
Ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
They are of the world : therefore speak they of the world , and the world heareth them .
We are of God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God heareth not us . Hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
Beloved , let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that loveth is born of God , and knoweth God .
He that loveth not knoweth not God ; for God is love .
Herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins .
Beloved , if God so loved us , we ought also to love one another .
No man hath seen God at any time . If we love one another , God dwelleth in us , and his love is perfected in us .
Hereby know we that we dwell in him , and he in us , because he hath given us of his Spirit .
And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world .
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us . God is love ; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God , and God in him .
Herein is our love made perfect , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment : because as he is , so are we in this world .
There is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out fear : because fear hath torment . He that feareth is not made perfect in love .
We love him , because he first loved us .
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God : and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him .
By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God , and keep his commandments .
For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous .
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory that overcometh the world , even our faith .
Who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God ?
This is he that came by water and blood , even Jesus Christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . And it is the Spirit that beareth witness , because the Spirit is truth .
And there are three that bear witness in earth , the spirit , and the water , and the blood : and these three agree in one .
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son .
He that hath the Son hath life ; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life .
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God ; that ye may know that ye have eternal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God .
And this is the confidence that we have in him , that , if we ask any thing according to his will , he heareth us :
And if we know that he hear us , whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him .
If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death , he shall ask , and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death . There is a sin unto death : I do not say that he shall pray for it .
All unrighteousness is sin : and there is a sin not unto death .
We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not ; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
And we know that we are of God , and the whole world lieth in wickedness .
And we know that the Son of God is come , and hath given us an understanding , that we may know him that is true , and we are in him that is true , even in his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God , and eternal life .
Little children , keep yourselves from idols . Amen .
For the truth 's sake , which dwelleth in us , and shall be with us for ever .
Grace be with you , mercy , and peace , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth , as we have received a commandment from the Father .
And this is love , that we walk after his commandments . This is the commandment , That , as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
For many deceivers are entered into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . This is a deceiver and an antichrist .
Look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
If there come any unto you , and bring not this doctrine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him God speed :
For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds .
Having many things to write unto you , I would not write with paper and ink : but I trust to come unto you , and speak face to face , that our joy may be full .
The children of thy elect sister greet thee . Amen .
Beloved , I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health , even as thy soul prospereth .
For I rejoiced greatly , when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee , even as thou walkest in the truth .
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth .
Beloved , thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren , and to strangers ;
Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church : whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort , thou shalt do well :
Because that for his name 's sake they went forth , taking nothing of the Gentiles .
We therefore ought to receive such , that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth .
Wherefore , if I come , I will remember his deeds which he doeth , prating against us with malicious words : and not content therewith , neither doth he himself receive the brethren , and forbiddeth them that would , and casteth them out of the church .
Demetrius hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
I had many things to write , but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee :
But I trust I shall shortly see thee , and we shall speak face to face . Peace be to thee . Our friends salute thee . Greet the friends by name .
Jude , the servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to them that are sanctified by God the Father , and preserved in Jesus Christ , and called :
For there are certain men crept in unawares , who were before of old ordained to this condemnation , ungodly men , turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness , and denying the only Lord God , and our Lord Jesus Christ .
And the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day .
Even as Sodom and Gomorrha , and the cities about them in like manner , giving themselves over to fornication , and going after strange flesh , are set forth for an example , suffering the vengeance of eternal fire .
Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh , despise dominion , and speak evil of dignities .
But these speak evil of those things which they know not : but what they know naturally , as brute beasts , in those things they corrupt themselves .
Woe unto them ! for they have gone in the way of Cain , and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Core .
These are spots in your feasts of charity , when they feast with you , feeding themselves without fear : clouds they are without water , carried about of winds ; trees whose fruit withereth , without fruit , twice dead , plucked up by the roots ;
Raging waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever .
These are murmurers , complainers , walking after their own lusts ; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words , having men 's persons in admiration because of advantage .
But , beloved , remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
These be they who separate themselves , sensual , having not the Spirit .
But ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Ghost ,
Keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life .
And of some have compassion , making a difference :
And others save with fear , pulling them out of the fire ; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh .
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling , and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy ,
To the only wise God our Saviour , be glory and majesty , dominion and power , both now and ever . Amen .
The Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John :
Who bare record of the word of God , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , and of all things that he saw .
Blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand .
And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
Behold , he cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pierced him : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him . Even so , Amen .
I John , who also am your brother , and companion in tribulation , and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was in the isle that is called Patmos , for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet ,
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me . And being turned , I saw seven golden candlesticks ;
His head and his hairs were white like wool , as white as snow ; and his eyes were as a flame of fire ;
And his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
And he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword : and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength .
Write the things which thou hast seen , and the things which are , and the things which shall be hereafter ;
And hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name 's sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen , and repent , and do the first works ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will remove thy candlestick out of his place , except thou repent .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of God .
Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer : behold , the devil shall cast some of you into prison , that ye may be tried ; and ye shall have tribulation ten days : be thou faithful unto death , and I will give thee a crown of life .
I know thy works , and where thou dwellest , even where Satan 's seat is : and thou holdest fast my name , and hast not denied my faith , even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr , who was slain among you , where Satan dwelleth .
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans , which thing I hate .
Repent ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication ; and she repented not .
But that which ye have already hold fast till I come .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
Be watchful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found thy works perfect before God .
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee .
He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
Behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; behold , I will make them to come and worship before thy feet , and to know that I have loved thee .
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God , and he shall go no more out : and I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , which is new Jerusalem , which cometh down out of heaven from my God : and I will write upon him my new name .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue thee out of my mouth .
Because thou sayest , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked :
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see .
Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me .
And immediately I was in the spirit : and , behold , a throne was set in heaven , and one sat on the throne .
And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone : and there was a rainbow round about the throne , in sight like unto an emerald .
And round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices : and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God .
And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal : and in the midst of the throne , and round about the throne , were four beasts full of eyes before and behind .
And the first beast was like a lion , and the second beast like a calf , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle .
And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne , who liveth for ever and ever ,
And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside , sealed with seven seals .
And no man in heaven , nor in earth , neither under the earth , was able to open the book , neither to look thereon .
And I wept much , because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book , neither to look thereon .
And I beheld , and , lo , in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts , and in the midst of the elders , stood a Lamb as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth .
And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne .
And when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
And I beheld , and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ;
And there went out another horse that was red : and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another : and there was given unto him a great sword .
And I looked , and behold a pale horse : and his name that sat on him was Death , and Hell followed with him . And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and with the beasts of the earth .
And when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
And white robes were given unto every one of them ; and it was said unto them , that they should rest yet for a little season , until their fellowservants also and their brethren , that should be killed as they were , should be fulfilled .
And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal , and , lo , there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ;
And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth , even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs , when she is shaken of a mighty wind .
And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
And the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief captains , and the mighty men , and every bondman , and every free man , hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains ;
And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
And I saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living God : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
After this I beheld , and , lo , a great multitude , which no man could number , of all nations , and kindreds , and people , and tongues , stood before the throne , and before the Lamb , clothed with white robes , and palms in their hands ;
And all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God ,
Therefore are they before the throne of God , and serve him day and night in his temple : and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them .
They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat .
And when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour .
And I saw the seven angels which stood before God ; and to them were given seven trumpets .
And another angel came and stood at the altar , having a golden censer ; and there was given unto him much incense , that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne .
And the smoke of the incense , which came with the prayers of the saints , ascended up before God out of the angel 's hand .
And the angel took the censer , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth : and there were voices , and thunderings , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
And the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ;
And the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters ;
And the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so as the third part of them was darkened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
And the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth : and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit .
And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
And to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
And in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
And they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
And they had tails like unto scorpions , and there were stings in their tails : and their power was to hurt men five months .
And they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon .
One woe is past ; and , behold , there come two woes more hereafter .
And the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
And the four angels were loosed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to slay the third part of men .
And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
By these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths .
For their power is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails were like unto serpents , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands , that they should not worship devils , and idols of gold , and silver , and brass , and stone , and of wood : which neither can see , nor hear , nor walk :
Neither repented they of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .
And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven , clothed with a cloud : and a rainbow was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pillars of fire :
And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven ,
And I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
But the court which is without the temple leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given unto the Gentiles : and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months .
These are the two olive trees , and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth .
And if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and devoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
These have power to shut heaven , that it rain not in the days of their prophecy : and have power over waters to turn them to blood , and to smite the earth with all plagues , as often as they will .
And when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also our Lord was crucified .
And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half , and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves .
And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them , and they stood upon their feet ; and great fear fell upon them which saw them .
And the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand : and the remnant were affrighted , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
The second woe is past ; and , behold , the third woe cometh quickly .
And the four and twenty elders , which sat before God on their seats , fell upon their faces , and worshipped God ,
And the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunderings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
And there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a crown of twelve stars :
And she being with child cried , travailing in birth , and pained to be delivered .
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
And she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne .
And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels ,
And prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven .
And the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb , and by the word of their testimony ; and they loved not their lives unto the death .
And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child .
And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood .
And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
And the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .
And I stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns , and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .
And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death ; and his deadly wound was healed : and all the world wondered after the beast .
And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months .
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his name , and his tabernacle , and them that dwell in heaven .
And it was given unto him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them : and power was given him over all kindreds , and tongues , and nations .
And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world .
He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity : he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . Here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth ; and he had two horns like a lamb , and he spake as a dragon .
And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him , and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
And he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men ,
And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast ; saying to them that dwell on the earth , that they should make an image to the beast , which had the wound by a sword , and did live .
And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
And he causeth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark in their right hand , or in their foreheads :
And that no man might buy or sell , save he that had the mark , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name .
And I looked , and , lo , a Lamb stood on the mount Sion , and with him an hundred forty and four thousand , having his Father 's name written in their foreheads .
And I heard a voice from heaven , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder : and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps :
And they sung as it were a new song before the throne , and before the four beasts , and the elders : and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand , which were redeemed from the earth .
These are they which were not defiled with women ; for they are virgins . These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth . These were redeemed from among men , being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb .
And in their mouth was found no guile : for they are without fault before the throne of God .
And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven , having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth , and to every nation , and kindred , and tongue , and people ,
The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God , which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation ; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels , and in the presence of the Lamb :
Here is the patience of the saints : here are they that keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus .
And I looked , and behold a white cloud , and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth ; and the earth was reaped .
And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
And the winepress was trodden without the city , and blood came out of the winepress , even unto the horse bridles , by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs .
And I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvellous , seven angels having the seven last plagues ; for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the beast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , stand on the sea of glass , having the harps of God .
And after that I looked , and , behold , the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened :
And the seven angels came out of the temple , having the seven plagues , clothed in pure and white linen , and having their breasts girded with golden girdles .
And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God , who liveth for ever and ever .
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
And the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which worshipped his image .
And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .
And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters ; and they became blood .
And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire .
And men were scorched with great heat , and blasphemed the name of God , which hath power over these plagues : and they repented not to give him glory .
And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness ; and they gnawed their tongues for pain ,
And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
For they are the spirits of devils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon .
And there were voices , and thunders , and lightnings ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake , and so great .
And the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon came in remembrance before God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
And every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness : and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast , full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication :
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus : and when I saw her , I wondered with great admiration .
The beast that thou sawest was , and is not ; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit , and go into perdition : and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder , whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world , when they behold the beast that was , and is not , and yet is .
And there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
And the beast that was , and is not , even he is the eighth , and is of the seven , and goeth into perdition .
These have one mind , and shall give their power and strength unto the beast .
And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and burn her with fire .
And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven , having great power ; and the earth was lightened with his glory .
For her sins have reached unto heaven , and God hath remembered her iniquities .
Therefore shall her plagues come in one day , death , and mourning , and famine ; and she shall be utterly burned with fire : for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her .
The merchandise of gold , and silver , and precious stones , and of pearls , and fine linen , and purple , and silk , and scarlet , and all thyine wood , and all manner vessels of ivory , and all manner vessels of most precious wood , and of brass , and iron , and marble ,
And the voice of harpers , and musicians , and of pipers , and trumpeters , shall be heard no more at all in thee ; and no craftsman , of whatsoever craft he be , shall be found any more in thee ; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee ;
And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee ; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee : for thy merchants were the great men of the earth ; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived .
Let us be glad and rejoice , and give honour to him : for the marriage of the Lamb is come , and his wife hath made herself ready .
And I saw heaven opened , and behold a white horse ; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness he doth judge and make war .
His eyes were as a flame of fire , and on his head were many crowns ; and he had a name written , that no man knew , but he himself .
And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood : and his name is called The Word of God .
And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses , clothed in fine linen , white and clean .
And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword , that with it he should smite the nations : and he shall rule them with a rod of iron : and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God .
And I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
And the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him , with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast , and them that worshipped his image . These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone .
And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse , which sword proceeded out of his mouth : and all the fowls were filled with their flesh .
And I saw an angel come down from heaven , having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand .
And he laid hold on the dragon , that old serpent , which is the Devil , and Satan , and bound him a thousand years ,
And cast him into the bottomless pit , and shut him up , and set a seal upon him , that he should deceive the nations no more , till the thousand years should be fulfilled : and after that he must be loosed a little season .
And I saw thrones , and they sat upon them , and judgment was given unto them : and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus , and for the word of God , and which had not worshipped the beast , neither his image , neither had received his mark upon their foreheads , or in their hands ; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years .
But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished . This is the first resurrection .
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection : on such the second death hath no power , but they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
And when the thousand years are expired , Satan shall be loosed out of his prison ,
And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
And they went up on the breadth of the earth , and compassed the camp of the saints about , and the beloved city : and fire came down from God out of heaven , and devoured them .
And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are , and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
And I saw the dead , small and great , stand before God ; and the books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged every man according to their works .
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire . This is the second death .
And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire .
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away ; and there was no more sea .
And I John saw the holy city , new Jerusalem , coming down from God out of heaven , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
He that overcometh shall inherit all things ; and I will be his God , and he shall be my son .
And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain , and shewed me that great city , the holy Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God ,
Having the glory of God : and her light was like unto a stone most precious , even like a jasper stone , clear as crystal ;
And had a wall great and high , and had twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels , and names written thereon , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel :
On the east three gates ; on the north three gates ; on the south three gates ; and on the west three gates .
And the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city , and the gates thereof , and the wall thereof .
And the city lieth foursquare , and the length is as large as the breadth : and he measured the city with the reed , twelve thousand furlongs . The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .
And he measured the wall thereof , an hundred and forty and four cubits , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the angel .
And the building of the wall of it was of jasper : and the city was pure gold , like unto clear glass .
And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones . The first foundation was jasper ; the second , sapphire ; the third , a chalcedony ; the fourth , an emerald ;
The fifth , sardonyx ; the sixth , sardius ; the seventh , chrysolite ; the eighth , beryl ; the ninth , a topaz ; the tenth , a chrysoprasus ; the eleventh , a jacinth ; the twelfth , an amethyst .
And the twelve gates were twelve pearls ; every several gate was of one pearl : and the street of the city was pure gold , as it were transparent glass .
And I saw no temple therein : for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it .
And the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to shine in it : for the glory of God did lighten it , and the Lamb is the light thereof .
And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it : and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it .
And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day : for there shall be no night there .
And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it .
And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth , neither whatsoever worketh abomination , or maketh a lie : but they which are written in the Lamb 's book of life .
And he shewed me a pure river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb .
In the midst of the street of it , and on either side of the river , was there the tree of life , which bare twelve manner of fruits , and yielded her fruit every month : and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
And there shall be no more curse : but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him :
And they shall see his face ; and his name shall be in their foreheads .
And there shall be no night there ; and they need no candle , neither light of the sun ; for the Lord God giveth them light : and they shall reign for ever and ever .
And I John saw these things , and heard them . And when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things .
I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , the first and the last .
For without are dogs , and sorcerers , and whoremongers , and murderers , and idolaters , and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie .
For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book , If any man shall add unto these things , God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book :
And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the holy city , and from the things which are written in this book .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .

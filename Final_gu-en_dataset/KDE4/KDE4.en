After pressing Ctrl+Alt+I, the KSIRC window will be activated, if it exists. Simple.

KSIRC
After pressing Alt+Ctrl+H the input of'Hello 'will be simulated, as if you typed it. This is especially useful if you have call to frequently type a word (for instance, 'unsigned'). Every keypress in the input is separated by a colon ':'. Note that the keypresses literally mean keypresses, so you have to write what you would press on the keyboard. In the table below, the left column shows the input and the right column shows what to type.\\ "enter" (i. e. new line) Enter or Return\ a (i. e. small a) A\ A (i. e. capital a) Shift+A\: (colon) Shift+;\ '' (space) Space
Type'Hello '
This action runs Konsole, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
Run Konsole
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Qt Designer uses Ctrl+F4 for closing windows. In KDE, however, Ctrl+F4 is the shortcut for going to virtual desktop 4, so this shortcut does not work in QT Designer. Further, Qt Designer does not use KDE's standard Ctrl+W for closing the window.\\ This problem can be solved by remapping Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 when the active window is Qt Designer. When Qt Designer is active, every time Ctrl+W is pressed, Ctrl+F4 will be sent to Qt Designer instead. In other applications, the effect of Ctrl+W is unchanged.\\ We now need to specify three things: A new shortcut trigger on'Ctrl+W', a new keyboard input action sending Ctrl+F4, and a new condition that the active window is Qt Designer.\ Qt Designer seems to always have title'Qt Designer by Trolltech ', so the condition will check for the active window having that title.
Remap Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 in Qt Designer
By pressing Alt+Ctrl+W a D-Bus call will be performed that will show the minicli. You can use any kind of D-Bus call, just like using the command line'qdbus' tool.
Perform D-Bus call'kdesktop KDesktopIface popupExecuteCommand() '
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Just like the "Type'Hello'" action, this one simulates keyboard input, specifically, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+B, it sends B to XMMS (B in XMMS jumps to the next song). The'Send to specific window 'checkbox is checked and a window with its class containing'XMMS_Player' is specified; this will make the input always be sent to this window. This way, you can control XMMS even if, for instance, it is on a different virtual desktop.\\ (Run'xprop 'and click on the XMMS window and search for WM_CLASS to see'XMMS_Player').
Next in XMMS

Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs, and now you can also have gestures.\\ Just press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, and after you are finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to paste the selection, it still works, just click the middle mouse button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\\ Right now, there are the following gestures available:\ move right and back left - Forward (Alt+Right)\ move left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\ move up and back down - Up (Alt+Up)\ circle anticlockwise - Reload (F5)\\ The gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you: gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\\ Note that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this, it is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once. For instance, 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform, but 1236987 may be already quite difficult.\\ The conditions for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains'konqueror ').

About Bug Reporting - Help
Information about bug reporting
You can help us improve this software by filing a bug report.
It is safe to close this dialog. If you do not want to, you do not have to file a bug report.
In order to generate a useful bug report we need some information about both the crash and your system. (You may also need to install some debug packages.)
Bug Reporting Assistant Guide
This assistant will guide you through the crash reporting process for the KDE Bug Reports Database Site. All the information you enter on the bug report must be in English, if possible, as KDE is formed internationally.
What do you know about the crash?
In this page you need to describe how much do you know about the desktop and the application state before it crashed.
If you can, describe in as much detail as possible the crash circumstances, and what you were doing when the application crashed (this information is going to be requested later.) You can mention:
actions you were taking inside or outside the application
documents or images that you were using and their type/ format (later if you go to look at the report in the bug tracking system, you can attach a file to the report)
widgets that you were running
the URL of a web site you were browsing
configuration details of the application
or other strange things you notice before or after the crash.
Screenshots can be very helpful sometimes. You can attach them to the bug report after it is posted to the bug tracking system.
Crash Information (backtrace)
This page will generate a "backtrace" of the crash. This is information that tells the developers where the application crashed.
If the crash information is not detailed enough, you may need to install some debug packages and reload it (if the Install Debug Symbols button is available you can use it to automatically install the missing information.)
You can find more information about backtraces, what they mean, and how they are useful at %1
Once you get a useful backtrace (or if you do not want to install the missing debugging packages) you can continue.
Conclusions
Using the quality of the crash information gathered, and your answers on the previous page, the assistant will tell you if the crash is worth reporting or not.
If the crash is worth reporting but the application is not supported in the KDE bug tracking system, you will need to directly contact the maintainer of the application.
If the crash is listed as being not worth reporting, and you think the assistant has made a mistake, you can still manually report the bug by logging into the bug tracking system. You can also go back and change information and download debug packages.
Login into the bug tracking system
We may need to contact you in the future to ask for further information. As we need to keep track of the bug reports, you need to have an account on the KDE bug tracking system. If you do not have one, you can create one here: %1
Then, enter your username and password and press the Login button. You can use this login to directly access the KDE bug tracking system later.
The KWallet dialog may appear when pressing Login to save your password in the KWallet password system. Also, it will prompt you for the KWallet password upon loading to autocomplete the login fields if you use this assistant again.
List of possible duplicate reports
This page will search the bug report database for similar crashes which are possible duplicates of your bug. If there are similar bug reports found, you can double click on them to see details. Then, read the current bug report information so you can check to see if they are similar.
If you are very sure your bug is the same as another that is previously reported, you can set your information to be attached to the existing report.
If you are unsure whether your report is the same, follow the main options to tentatively mark your crash as a duplicate of that report. This is usually the safest thing to do. We cannot uncombine bug reports, but we can easily merge them.
If not enough possible duplicates are found, or you did not find a similar report, then you can force it to search for more bug reports (only if the date range limit is not reached.)
If you do not find any related reports, your crash information is not useful enough, and you really cannot give additional information about the crash context, then it is better to not file the bug report, thereby closing the assistant.
Details of the bug report and your system
In this case you need to write a title and description of the crash. Explain as best you can.
You can also specify your distribution method (GNU/ Linux distribution or packaging system) or if you compiled the KDE Platform from sources.
You should write in English.
Sending the Crash Report
The last page will send the bug report to the bug tracking system and will notify you when it is done. It will then show the web address of the bug report in the KDE bug tracking system, so that you can look at the report later.
If the process fails, you can click Retry to try sending the bug report again. If the report cannot be sent because the bug tracking database has a problem, you can save it to a file to manually report later.
Thank you for being part of KDE!
If you are interested into helping us to organize bug reports allowing the developers to focus on fixing the real issues, join the BugSquad (#kde-bugs on FreeNode IRC)

If this option is checked, the default system bell will be used. See the "System Bell" control module for how to customize the system bell. Normally, this is just a "beep".
Check this option if you want to use a customized bell, playing a sound file. If you do this, you will probably want to turn off the system bell. Please note that on slow machines this may cause a "lag" between the event causing the bell and the sound being played.
Sound & to play:

If the option "Use customized bell" is enabled, you can choose a sound file here. Click "Browse..." to choose a sound file using the file dialog.
Visible Bell
& Use visible bell
This option will turn on the "visible bell", i. e. a visible notification shown every time that normally just a bell would occur. This is especially useful for deaf people.

If you have a TFT or LCD screen you can further improve the quality of displayed fonts by selecting this option. Sub-pixel rendering is also known as ClearType(tm). In order for sub-pixel rendering to work correctly you need to know how the sub-pixels of your display are aligned. On TFT or LCD displays a single pixel is actually composed of three sub-pixels, red, green and blue. Most displays have a linear ordering of RGB sub-pixel, some have BGR. This feature does not work with CRT monitors.

Force fonts DPI:
96 DPI
120 DPI
This option forces a specific DPI value for fonts. It may be useful when the real DPI of the hardware is not detected properly and it is also often misused when poor quality fonts are used that do not look well with DPI values other than 96 or 120 DPI. The use of this option is generally discouraged. For selecting proper DPI value a better option is explicitly configuring it for the whole X server if possible (e. g. DisplaySize in xorg. conf or adding -dpi value to ServerLocalArgs= in $KDEDIR/ share/ config/ kdm/ kdmrc). When fonts do not render properly with real DPI value better fonts should be used or configuration of font hinting should be checked.
Some changes such as anti-aliasing will only affect newly started applications.

Service Manager This module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the KDE Daemon, also referred to as KDE Services. Generally, there are two types of service: Services invoked at startup Services called on demand The latter are only listed for convenience. The startup services can be started and stopped. In Administrator mode, you can also define whether services should be loaded at startup. Use this with care: some services are vital for KDE; do not deactivate services if you do not know what you are doing.

Keyboard Repeat
If you check this option, pressing and holding down a key emits the same character over and over again. For example, pressing and holding down the Tab key will have the same effect as that of pressing that key several times in succession: Tab characters continue to be emitted until you release the key.
& Enable keyboard repeat
& Delay:
If supported, this option allows you to set the delay after which a pressed key will start generating keycodes. The'Repeat rate 'option controls the frequency of these keycodes.
& Rate:
If supported, this option allows you to set the rate at which keycodes are generated while a key is pressed.
If supported, this option allows you to hear audible clicks from your computer's speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard. This might be useful if your keyboard does not have mechanical keys, or if the sound that the keys make is very soft. You can change the loudness of the key click feedback by dragging the slider button or by clicking the up/ down arrows on the spin box. Setting the volume to 0% turns off the key click.

Local Network Browsing Here you setup your "Network Neighborhood". You can use either the LISa daemon and the lan: / ioslave, or the ResLISa daemon and the rlan: / ioslave. About the LAN ioslave configuration: If you select it, the ioslave, if available, will check whether the host supports this service when you open this host. Please note that paranoid people might consider even this to be an attack. Always means that you will always see the links for the services, regardless of whether they are actually offered by the host. Never means that you will never have the links to the services. In both cases you will not contact the host, so nobody will ever regard you as an attacker. More information about LISa can be found at the LISa Homepage or contact Alexander Neundorf & lt; neundorf@kde. org gt;.

Allow previews, "Folder Icons Reflect Contents", and retrieval of meta-data on protocols:
Preview Options Here you can modify the behavior of Konqueror when it shows the files in a folder. The list of protocols: check the protocols over which previews should be shown; uncheck those over which they should not. For instance, you might want to show previews over SMB if the local network is fast enough, but you might disable it for FTP if you often visit very slow FTP sites with large images. Maximum File Size: select the maximum file size for which previews should be generated. For instance, if set to 1 MB (the default), no preview will be generated for files bigger than 1 MB, for speed reasons.

Konqueror Stylesheets This module allows you to apply your own color and font settings to Konqueror by using stylesheets (CSS). You can either specify options or apply your own self-written stylesheet by pointing to its location. Note that these settings will always have precedence before all other settings made by the site author. This can be useful to visually impaired people or for web pages that are unreadable due to bad design.
Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 User defined stylesheets allow increased accessibility for visually handicapped people.
Expression (e. g. http: / /www. example. com/ ad/ *):
Enter an expression to filter. Expressions can be defined as either a filename style wildcard e. g. http: / /www. example. com/ ads* or as a full regular expression by surrounding the string with '/ 'e. g. / /(ad_BAR_banner)\\. /
Enhanced Browsing In this module you can configure some enhanced browsing features of KDE. Web Shortcuts Web Shortcuts are a quick way of using Web search engines. For example, type "altavista: frobozz" or "av: frobozz" and Konqueror will do a search on AltaVista for "frobozz". Even easier: just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the KDE Run Command dialog.

Physical Memory
This graph gives you an overview of the usage of physical memory in your system. Most operating systems (including Linux) will use as much of the available physical memory as possible as disk cache, to speed up the system performance. This means that if you have a small amount of Free Physical Memory and a large amount of Disk Cache Memory, your system is well configured.

System
Konqueror Performance You can configure several settings that improve Konqueror performance here. These include options for reusing already running instances and for keeping instances preloaded.
Disables the minimization of memory usage and allows you to make each browsing activity independent from the others
With this option activated, only one instance of Konqueror used for file browsing will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment, no matter how many file browsing windows you open, thus reducing resource requirements. Be aware that this also means that, if something goes wrong, all your file browsing windows will be closed simultaneously
With this option activated, only one instance of Konqueror will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment, no matter how many browsing windows you open, thus reducing resource requirements. Be aware that this also means that, if something goes wrong, all your browsing windows will be closed simultaneously.
If non-zero, this option allows keeping Konqueror instances in memory after all their windows have been closed, up to the number specified in this option. When a new Konqueror instance is needed, one of these preloaded instances will be reused instead, improving responsiveness at the expense of the memory required by the preloaded instances.
If enabled, an instance of Konqueror will be preloaded after the ordinary KDE startup sequence. This will make the first Konqueror window open faster, but at the expense of longer KDE startup times (but you will be able to work while it is loading, so you may not even notice that it is taking longer).
If enabled, KDE will always try to have one preloaded Konqueror instance ready; preloading a new instance in the background whenever there is not one available, so that windows will always open quickly. Warning: In some cases, it is actually possible that this will reduce perceived performance.

System Configuration
Disable & system configuration startup check
This option may in rare cases lead to various problems. Consult the What's This (Shift+F1) help for details.
During startup KDE needs to perform a check of its system configuration (mimetypes, installed applications, etc.), and in case the configuration has changed since the last time, the system configuration cache (KSyCoCa) needs to be updated. This option delays the check, which avoid scanning all directories containing files describing the system during KDE startup, thus making KDE startup faster. However, in the rare case the system configuration has changed since the last time, and the change is needed before this delayed check takes place, this option may lead to various problems (missing applications in the K Menu, reports from applications about missing required mimetypes, etc.). Changes of system configuration mostly happen by (un)installing applications. It is therefore recommended to turn this option temporarily off while (un)installing applications.

& Statistics
The Samba and NFS Status Monitor is a front end to the programs smbstatus and showmount. Smbstatus reports on current Samba connections, and is part of the suite of Samba tools, which implements the SMB (Session Message Block) protocol, also called the NetBIOS or LanManager protocol. This protocol can be used to provide printer sharing or drive sharing services on a network including machines running the various flavors of Microsoft Windows.

Unable to contact the KDE smartcard service.
Possible Reasons
1) The KDE daemon, 'kded 'is not running. You can restart it by running the command'kdeinit' and then try reloading the KDE System Settings to see if this message goes away. 2) You do not appear to have smartcard support in the KDE libraries. You will need to recompile the kdelibs package with libpcsclite installed.
Smartcard Support
& Enable smartcard support
Enable & polling to autodetect card events
In most cases you should have this enabled. It allows KDE to automatically detect card insertion and reader hotplug events.
Automatically & launch card manager if inserted card is unclaimed
When you insert a smartcard, KDE can automatically launch a management tool if no other application attempts to use the card.

smartcard This module allows you to configure KDE support for smartcards. These can be used for various tasks such as storing SSL certificates and logging in to the system.
Session Manager You can configure the session manager here. This includes options such as whether or not the session exit (logout) should be confirmed, whether the session should be restored again when logging in and whether the computer should be automatically shut down after session exit by default.
General
Check this option if you want the session manager to display a logout confirmation dialog box.
Confirm logout
Offer shutdown options
Here you can choose what should happen by default when you log out. This only has meaning, if you logged in through KDM.
Default Leave Option

& Turn off computer
& Restart computer
Restore previous session: Will save all applications running on exit and restore them when they next start up Restore manually saved session: Allows the session to be saved at any time via "Save Session" in the K-Menu. This means the currently started applications will reappear when they next start up. Start with an empty session: Do not save anything. Will come up with an empty desktop on next start.

Font Installer This module allows you to install TrueType, Type1, and Bitmap fonts. You may also install fonts using Konqueror: type fonts: / into Konqueror's location bar and this will display your installed fonts. To install a font, simply copy it into the appropriate folder - "Personal" for fonts available to just yourself, or "System" for system-wide fonts (available to all). NOTE: As you are not logged in as "root", any fonts installed will only be available to you. To install fonts system-wide, use the "Administrator Mode" button to run this module as "root".
Detailed View
Type
Output:
Configure fonts for legacy X applications
Modern applications use a system called "FontConfig" to obtain the list of fonts. Older applications, such as OpenOffice 1. x, GIMP 1. x, etc. use the previous "core X fonts" mechanism for this. Selecting this option will inform the installer to create the necessary files so that these older applications can use the fonts you install. Please note, however, that this will slow down the installation process.
Configure fonts for Ghostscript
You have enabled a previously disabled option. Would you like the config files updated now? (Normally they are only updated upon installing, or removing, a font.)
Do Not Update
Only fonts may be installed. If installing a fonts package (*%1), then extract the components, and install individually.
Where do you wish to install "%1" (%2)? "%3" - only accessible to you, or "%4" - accessible to all (requires administrator password)

KIO Client
Command-line tool for network-transparent operations
Syntax:
kioclient openProperties'url '# Opens a properties menu
kioclient exec'url '['mimetype'] # Tries to open the document pointed to by'url ', in the application # associated with it in KDE. You may omit'mimetype'. # In this case the mimetype is determined # automatically. Of course URL may be the URL of a # document, or it may be a *. desktop file. # 'url 'can be an executable, too.
kioclient move'src ''dest' # Moves the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
kioclient download ['src '] # Copies the URL'src' to a user-specified location '. # 'src' may be a list of URLs, if not present then # a URL will be requested.
kioclient copy'src ''dest' # Copies the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
kioclient cat'url '# Writes out the contents of'url' to stdout
kioclient remove'url '# Removes the URL # 'url' may be a list of URLs.
*** Examples: kioclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ cdrom. desktop "Mount default" / / Mounts the CDROM
kioclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html / / Opens the file with default binding
kioclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html Netscape / / Opens the file with netscape
kioclient exec ftp: / /localhost/ / / Opens new window with URL
kioclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ emacs. desktop / / Starts emacs
kioclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ cdrom. desktop / / Opens the CDROM's mount directory
kioclient exec. / / Opens the current directory. Very convenient.

Clipboard/ Selection Behavior
Separate clipboard and selection
This option prevents the selection being recorded in the clipboard history. Only explicit clipboard changes are recorded.
There are two different clipboard buffers available: Clipboard is filled by selecting something and pressing Ctrl+C, or by clicking "Copy" in a toolbar or menubar. Selection is available immediately after selecting some text. The only way to access the selection is to press the middle mouse button. You can configure the relationship between Clipboard and Selection.

Screen saver timeout
Sets the seconds after which the screen saver is started.
Suspend screen saver when DPMS kicks in
Usually the screen saver is suspended when display power saving kicks in, as nothing can be seen on the screen anyway, obviously. However, some screen savers actually perform useful computations, so it is not desirable to suspend them.

PowerDevil was compiled without Xss and Xext support, or the XSync extension is not available. Determining idle time will not be possible. Please consider recompiling PowerDevil with at least one of these two libraries.
PowerDevil was compiled without Xext support, or the XSync extension is not available. XSync grants extra efficiency and performance, saving your battery and CPU. It is advised to use PowerDevil with XSync enabled.
XSync does not seem to be your preferred query backend, though it is available on your system. Using it largely improves performance and efficiency, and is strongly advised. Click on the button below to enable it now.
Enable XSync Backend
Support for the XSync extension
XSync is an extension that allows high efficiency query of the system. If it is available, PowerDevil will be much more reliable and efficient
XSync Support
Support for XScreensaver
Through XScreensaver, PowerDevil may query the system if XSync is not available. It is necessary only if your system does not support XSync. If both of them are unavailable, PowerDevil will not be able to query idle time of the system
XScreenSaver Support
Support for XTest extension
Through XTest, PowerDevil is able to fake user activity, preventing suspension loops. If it is not available, loops might occur

The equation solver allows you to balance a chemical equation. Using VariablesTo express variable quantities of an element, put a single character in front of the element's symbol, as shown in this example: aH + bO - > 5H2O (Result: 10 H + 5 O -gt; 5 H2O)Solving this expression will give you the needed amount of Hydrogen and Oxygen. Defining electric chargesUse box brackets to specify the electric charge of an element, as shown in this example:4H[+] + 2O - > cH2O[2+] (Result: 4 H+ + 2 O -gt; 2 H2O2+)

About KDE
KDE - Be Free! Platform Version %1
KDEis a world-wide network of software engineers, artists, writers, translators and facilitators who are committed to Free Softwaredevelopment. This community has created hundreds of Free Software applications as part of the KDE Development Platform and KDE Software Distribution. KDE is a cooperative enterprise in which no single entity controls the efforts or products of KDE to the exclusion of others. Everyone is welcome to join and contribute to KDE, including you. Visit http://www.kde.orgfor more information about the KDE community and the software we produce.
Software can always be improved, and the KDE team isready to do so. However, you - the user - must tell us when something does not work as expected or could be done better. KDE has a bug tracking system. Visit http://bugs.kde.orgor use the "Report Bug..." dialog from the "Help" menu to report bugs. If you have a suggestion for improvement then you are welcome to use the bug tracking system to register your wish. Make sure you use the severity called "Wishlist".
You do not have to be a software developer to be a member of the KDE team. You can join the national teams that translate program interfaces. You can provide graphics, themes, sounds, and improved documentation. You decide! Visit http://www.kde.org/jobs/for information on some projects in which you can participate. If you need more information or documentation, then a visit to http://techbase.kde.orgwill provide you with what you need.
KDE is available free of charge, but costs are incurred and assets formed in its creation. Thus, the KDE community formed KDE e.V., a non-profit organization legally founded in Tuebingen, Germany. KDE e.V. represents the KDE community in legal and financial matters. See http://www.kde-ev.orgfor information on KDE e.V. KDE benefits from financial support. Most of the funds raised are used to reimburse members and others for expenses they incur when contributing to KDE. You are encouraged to support KDE through a financial donation, using one of the ways described at http://www.kde.org/support/. Thank you very much in advance for your support.

This option enables some convenient features for saving files with extensions: Any extension specified in the %1 text area will be updated if you change the file type to save in. If no extension is specified in the %2 text area when you click Save, %3 will be added to the end of the filename (if the filename does not already exist). This extension is based on the file type that you have chosen to save in. If you do not want KDE to supply an extension for the filename, you can either turn this option off or you can suppress it by adding a period (.) to the end of the filename (the period will be automatically removed). If unsure, keep this option enabled as it makes your files more manageable.
This button allows you to bookmark specific locations. Click on this button to open the bookmark menu where you may add, edit or select a bookmark. These bookmarks are specific to the file dialog, but otherwise operate like bookmarks elsewhere in KDE.

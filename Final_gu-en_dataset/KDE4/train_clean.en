Allow previews , " Folder Icons Reflect Contents " , and retrieval of meta-data on protocols :
Preview Options Here you can modify the behavior of Konqueror when it shows the files in a folder . The list of protocols : check the protocols over which previews should be shown ; uncheck those over which they should not . For instance , you might want to show previews over SMB if the local network is fast enough , but you might disable it for FTP if you often visit very slow FTP sites with large images . Maximum File Size : select the maximum file size for which previews should be generated . For instance , if set to 1 MB ( the default ) , no preview will be generated for files bigger than 1 MB , for speed reasons .
Local Protocols
& Maximum file size :
& Use thumbnails embedded in files
Select this to use thumbnails that are found inside some file types ( e. g . JPEG ) . This will increase speed and reduce disk usage . Deselect it if you have files that have been processed by programs which create inaccurate thumbnails , such as ImageMagick .

System
Konqueror Performance You can configure several settings that improve Konqueror performance here . These include options for reusing already running instances and for keeping instances preloaded .
Disables the minimization of memory usage and allows you to make each browsing activity independent from the others
With this option activated , only one instance of Konqueror used for file browsing will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment , no matter how many file browsing windows you open , thus reducing resource requirements . Be aware that this also means that , if something goes wrong , all your file browsing windows will be closed simultaneously
With this option activated , only one instance of Konqueror will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment , no matter how many browsing windows you open , thus reducing resource requirements . Be aware that this also means that , if something goes wrong , all your browsing windows will be closed simultaneously .
If non-zero , this option allows keeping Konqueror instances in memory after all their windows have been closed , up to the number specified in this option . When a new Konqueror instance is needed , one of these preloaded instances will be reused instead , improving responsiveness at the expense of the memory required by the preloaded instances .
If enabled , an instance of Konqueror will be preloaded after the ordinary KDE startup sequence . This will make the first Konqueror window open faster , but at the expense of longer KDE startup times ( but you will be able to work while it is loading , so you may not even notice that it is taking longer ) .
Minimize Memory Usage
Preloading
Preload an instance after KDE startup
Always try to have at least one preloaded instance

Font Installer This module allows you to install TrueType , Type1 , and Bitmap fonts . You may also install fonts using Konqueror : type fonts : / into Konqueror 's location bar and this will display your installed fonts . To install a font , simply copy it into the appropriate folder - " Personal " for fonts available to just yourself , or " System " for system-wide fonts ( available to all ) . NOTE : As you are not logged in as " root " , any fonts installed will only be available to you . To install fonts system-wide , use the " Administrator Mode " button to run this module as " root " .

Output :
Configure fonts for legacy X applications
Modern applications use a system called " FontConfig " to obtain the list of fonts . Older applications , such as OpenOffice 1. x , GIMP 1. x , etc. use the previous " core X fonts " mechanism for this . Selecting this option will inform the installer to create the necessary files so that these older applications can use the fonts you install . Please note , however , that this will slow down the installation process .
Configure fonts for Ghostscript
You have enabled a previously disabled option . Would you like the config files updated now ? ( Normally they are only updated upon installing , or removing , a font . )
Do Not Update
Only fonts may be installed . If installing a fonts package ( * % 1 ) , then extract the components , and install individually .
Where do you wish to install " % 1 " ( % 2 ) ? " % 3 " - only accessible to you , or " % 4 " - accessible to all ( requires administrator password )
% 1 : % 2 successfully installed .

Screen saver timeout
Sets the seconds after which the screen saver is started .
Usually the screen saver is suspended when display power saving kicks in , as nothing can be seen on the screen anyway , obviously . However , some screen savers actually perform useful computations , so it is not desirable to suspend them .

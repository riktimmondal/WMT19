Just because a crosswalk looks like a hopscotch board doesn 't mean it is one
Look both ways before you cross the street

Odessa is a better game . Really .
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now ...
If you 're ever lost and alone in the woods , hug a tree
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key
When without a stapler , a staple and a ruler will work
Never blow in a dog 's ear

This header , if added , will list all of your recipients in your message . To avoid this , you should add at least one To : or CC : recipient .

Before calibrating the display , it is recommended to configure your display with the following settings to get optimal results .
You may want to consult the owner 's manual for your display on how to achieve these settings .
Disable dynamic contrast if your display has this feature .
Adjust the display brightness to a comfortable level for prolonged viewing .
For best results , the display should have been powered for at least 15 minutes before starting the calibration .
Check Settings

Choose calibration quality
Higher quality calibration requires many color samples and more time .
A higher precision profile provides higher accuracy in color matching but requires more time for reading the color patches .
For a typical workflow , a normal precision profile is sufficient .
The high precision profile also requires more paper and printer ink .

Benchmark Settings
Benchmarking involves measuring the transfer rate on various area of the device as well as measuring how long it takes to seek from one random area to another . Please back up important data before using the write benchmark .
Transfer Rate
Benchmarking the write-rate of a disk requires exclusive access to the disk ( e.g. the disk or its partitions cannot be mounted or in use ) and involves reading data and then writing it back . As a result , the contents of the disk is not changed . If not checked , the write-part of the benchmark will not be done but on the other hand exclusive access to the device is not needed ( e.g. the disk or device can be in use ) .
Number of samples . Bigger number produces a more accurate picture of access time patterns but takes more time .
Access Time
Number of samples . Bigger number produces more smooth graphs but the benchmark will take more time .

Benchmark Settings
Benchmarking involves measuring the transfer rate on various area of the device as well as measuring how long it takes to seek from one random area to another . Please back up important data before using the write benchmark .
Transfer Rate
Benchmarking the write-rate of a disk requires exclusive access to the disk ( e.g. the disk or its partitions cannot be mounted or in use ) and involves reading data and then writing it back . As a result , the contents of the disk is not changed . If not checked , the write-part of the benchmark will not be done but on the other hand exclusive access to the device is not needed ( e.g. the disk or device can be in use ) .
Number of samples . Bigger number produces a more accurate picture of access time patterns but takes more time .
Access Time
Number of samples . Bigger number produces more smooth graphs but the benchmark will take more time .

Benchmark Settings
Benchmarking involves measuring the transfer rate on various area of the device as well as measuring how long it takes to seek from one random area to another . Please back up important data before using the write benchmark .
Transfer Rate
Benchmarking the write-rate of a disk requires exclusive access to the disk ( e.g. the disk or its partitions cannot be mounted or in use ) and involves reading data and then writing it back . As a result , the contents of the disk is not changed . If not checked , the write-part of the benchmark will not be done but on the other hand exclusive access to the device is not needed ( e.g. the disk or device can be in use ) .
Number of samples . Bigger number produces a more accurate picture of access time patterns but takes more time .
Access Time
Number of samples . Bigger number produces more smooth graphs but the benchmark will take more time .

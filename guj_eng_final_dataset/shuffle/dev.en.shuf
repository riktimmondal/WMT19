Konqueror Fonts On this page , you can configure which fonts Konqueror should use to display the web pages you view .
Insert
Preview Options Here you can modify the behavior of Konqueror when it shows the files in a folder . The list of protocols : check the protocols over which previews should be shown ; uncheck those over which they should not . For instance , you might want to show previews over SMB if the local network is fast enough , but you might disable it for FTP if you often visit very slow FTP sites with large images . Maximum File Size : select the maximum file size for which previews should be generated . For instance , if set to 1 MB ( the default ) , no preview will be generated for files bigger than 1 MB , for speed reasons .

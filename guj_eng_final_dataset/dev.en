& Previews & & Meta-Data
Allow previews , " Folder Icons Reflect Contents " , and retrieval of meta-data on protocols :
Preview Options Here you can modify the behavior of Konqueror when it shows the files in a folder . The list of protocols : check the protocols over which previews should be shown ; uncheck those over which they should not . For instance , you might want to show previews over SMB if the local network is fast enough , but you might disable it for FTP if you often visit very slow FTP sites with large images . Maximum File Size : select the maximum file size for which previews should be generated . For instance , if set to 1 MB ( the default ) , no preview will be generated for files bigger than 1 MB , for speed reasons .
Local Protocols
& Maximum file size :
& Use thumbnails embedded in files
Select this to use thumbnails that are found inside some file types ( e. g . JPEG ) . This will increase speed and reduce disk usage . Deselect it if you have files that have been processed by programs which create inaccurate thumbnails , such as ImageMagick .
